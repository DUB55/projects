# Problem Set 04: Shape Layers and Paths

### **Goal**
Create vector graphics directly in After Effects.

### **Tasks**
1. **Shape Tools**: Create Rectangles, Ellipses, and Polygons.
2. **Fill and Stroke**: Adjust colors, gradients, and stroke width.
3. **Trim Paths**: Use the `Trim Paths` operator to animate a line drawing itself.
4. **Repeater**: Use the `Repeater` operator to create complex patterns from a single shape.

### **Practice Drill**
Animate a "Loading Circle". Use an Ellipse with a Stroke, apply `Trim Paths`, and animate the `Start` and `End` properties to make it spin and grow.
