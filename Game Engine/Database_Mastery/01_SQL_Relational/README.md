# SQL and Relational Databases

The gold standard for structured data.

## Concepts
- **Tables and Rows**: Like a spreadsheet but more powerful.
- **JOINs**: Connecting data from different tables.
- **ACID Properties**: Ensuring data remains accurate even if the system crashes.

## Challenge
1. Create a database for a library with tables for `Books`, `Authors`, and `Members`.
2. Write a query to find all books written by a specific author.
