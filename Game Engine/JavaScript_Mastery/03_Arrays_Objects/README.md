# Arrays and Objects in JS

Managing data structures in the browser.

## Concepts
- **Arrays**: `map`, `filter`, `reduce` (The "Holy Trinity" of array methods).
- **Objects**: Key-Value pairs, methods, and the `this` keyword.
- **Destructuring**: Pulling values out of arrays and objects easily.
- **Spread/Rest Operator**: `...` (Powerful for copying and combining data).

## Challenge
1. Create an array of numbers and use `filter` to find all even numbers.
2. Create an object representing a "User" and use destructuring to pull out their name and email.
3. Use the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
