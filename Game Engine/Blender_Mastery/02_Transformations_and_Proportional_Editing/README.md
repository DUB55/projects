# Problem Set 02: Transformations and Proportional Editing

### **Goal**
Understand precision movement and organic shaping using proportional editing.

### **Tasks**
1. **Precision Input**: Move an object exactly 5 units on the X-axis (`G`, `X`, `5`).
2. **Pivot Points**: Change the pivot point to `3D Cursor` and rotate an object around it.
3. **Proportional Editing**: Enable with `O`. Use `Scroll` to change the influence radius while moving vertices.
4. **Loop Selection**: Use `Alt + Left Click` to select an entire edge loop.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a simple "mountain" or "hill" by starting with a highly subdivided plane and pulling the center vertex up with Proportional Editing (set to `Smooth` or `Random`).
