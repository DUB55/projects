# Problem Set 1: HTML Basics

HTML is the skeleton of the web. Everything you see on a page is an HTML element.

## Concepts Covered
- **Document Structure**: `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`.
- **Text Elements**: `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<span>`.
- **Lists**: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`.
- **Links and Images**: `<a>`, `<img>`.

## The Exercises

### 1. Your First Page
Create an `index.html` file with a proper structure. Include a title in the head and a main heading in the body.

### 2. The Content Mix
Add a paragraph about why you want to build a game engine. Below it, create an unordered list of the 3 languages you're learning (C, C++, Python).

### 3. Navigation
Create a link that points to `https://google.com` and make it open in a new tab.

## Tip
Use the `!` shortcut in VS Code/Trae inside an HTML file to generate the boilerplate code automatically!
