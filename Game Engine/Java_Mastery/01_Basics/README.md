# Problem Set 1: Java Basics

Java is a robust, strictly typed language. It's the language that powered Minecraft and billions of other devices.

## Concepts Covered
- **Printing**: `System.out.println()`.
- **The Scanner**: `import java.util.Scanner;` for user input.
- **Variables**: `int`, `String`, `double`, `boolean`.
- **Classes**: Everything must be inside a `public class`.

## The Exercises

### 1. Hello Java
Create a class called `Main`. Inside the `main` method, print "Java Mastery Started!".

### 2. User Input
Use a `Scanner` to ask for the user's name. Print "Hello " followed by their name.

### 3. Basic Math
Ask for two integers. Print their sum and their average. Note: To get a decimal average, you'll need to cast one of the integers to a `double`.

## Comparison to Python
Java is much more "strict" than Python. You have to tell the computer exactly what type of data every variable holds, and you have to wrap everything in a class. This makes your code very stable!
