# Problem Set 04: Color Correction (Lumetri)

### **Goal**
Balance your shots and add a creative "look".

### **Tasks**
1. **Basic Correction**: Adjust White Balance, Exposure, Contrast, and Saturation.
2. **Lumetri Scopes**: Use the `Waveform` and `Parade` to ensure your whites aren't clipping and your blacks aren't crushed.
3. **HSL Secondary**: Select a specific color (like skin tones) and adjust it without affecting the rest of the image.
4. **Vignette**: Add a subtle vignette to draw focus to the center of the frame.

### **Practice Drill**
Take two clips shot at different times of day and "color match" them so they look like they were part of the same scene.
