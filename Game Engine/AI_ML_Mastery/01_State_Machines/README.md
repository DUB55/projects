# Finite State Machines (FSM)

The most basic form of AI logic.

## Concepts
- **States**: Idle, Patrol, Attack, Flee.
- **Transitions**: The rules for moving between states (e.g., "If health < 20%, transition to Flee").

## Challenge
1. Build a simple NPC controller in C# or Python that uses an FSM to switch between "Patrol" and "Chase".
2. Add a third state called "Heal" that triggers when a variable is low.
