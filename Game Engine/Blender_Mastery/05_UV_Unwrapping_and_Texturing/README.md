# Problem Set 05: UV Unwrapping and Texturing

### **Goal**
Learn how to "flatten" 3D objects into 2D maps for texturing.

### **Tasks**
1. **Seams**: Mark seams (`Ctrl + E` -> `Mark Seam`) on a cube to unwrap it like a cross.
2. **Unwrap**: Press `U` -> `Unwrap`.
3. **UV Editor**: Move, scale, and rotate UV islands in the `UV Editor`.
4. **Texture Painting**: Switch to `Texture Paint` mode and paint directly on your 3D model.

### **Practice Drill**
Unwrap a simple "Crate" (a cube with beveled edges). Apply a wood texture image and ensure the grain flows correctly on all sides.
