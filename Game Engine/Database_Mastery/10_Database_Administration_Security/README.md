### **Goal**
Manage, backup, and secure your data.

### **Tasks**
1. **Backups**: Differentiate between Full, Differential, and Incremental backups.
2. **Point-in-Time Recovery**: How do you restore a database to exactly 10:05 AM yesterday?
3. **RBAC**: Create users with specific permissions (e.g., Read-Only, Data-Entry).
4. **Encryption**: Explain "Encryption at Rest" and "Encryption in Transit".

### **Practice Drill**
Perform a backup of a local database, delete a table, and then restore it from the backup.
