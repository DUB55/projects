# Design Patterns

Proven solutions to common software design problems.

## Categories
- **Creational**: How objects are created (e.g., Singleton, Factory).
- **Structural**: How objects are composed (e.g., Adapter, Decorator).
- **Behavioral**: How objects communicate (e.g., Observer, Strategy).

## Challenge
1. Implement the "Singleton" pattern in a language of your choice.
2. Research the "Observer" pattern and how it's used in modern UI frameworks (like React or Vue).
3. Read about the "SOLID" principles of object-oriented design.
