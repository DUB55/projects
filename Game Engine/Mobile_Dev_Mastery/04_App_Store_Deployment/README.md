# App Store and Play Store Deployment

Getting your app into the hands of millions.

## Concepts
- **Signing and Certificates**: Proving that the app was built by you.
- **Beta Testing**: Using "TestFlight" (iOS) or "Internal Testing" (Android).
- **App Store Optimization (ASO)**: Keywords, screenshots, and descriptions.
- **Review Process**: Understanding the rules for getting your app approved.

## Challenge
1. Research the cost of an Apple Developer Program vs. a Google Play Developer account.
2. Read about the most common reasons why apps are rejected by the App Store.
3. Plan out the "Release Strategy" for a hypothetical app.
