# Problem Set 04: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

### **Goal**
Define and provision infrastructure using code.

### **Tasks**
1. **Providers and Resources**: Write a Terraform file that defines an AWS S3 bucket.
2. **State Management**: Explain the importance of the `terraform.tfstate` file.
3. **Variables and Outputs**: Use variables to make your configuration reusable.
4. **Terraform Lifecycle**: Explain `init`, `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy`.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a Terraform configuration that launches a small virtual machine (EC2 instance) and outputs its public IP address.
