## ❓ Quick Questions

**Q: Do I need to read all 7 documents?**  
A: No. Start with README_PLAN.md (10 min), then EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (10 min), then decide if you need the rest.

**Q: Can we start coding before reading all documents?**  
A: Not recommended. At minimum, read README_PLAN.md + QUICK_START.md + BLUEPRINT.md Phase 1 before starting.

**Q: What if we want to ship faster?**  
A: Compress to MVP (Phase 5, Day 40). Skip advanced features (Phases 8–10) initially.

**Q: What if we don't have 90 days?**  
A: See resource allocation in QUICK_START.md. 2 people = 60 days, 3 people = 45–50 days.

**Q: What if phases take longer than planned?**  
A: Adjust timeline. The plan is flexible. Report blockers early.
