# Problem Set 01: Navigation and Mesh Basics

### **Goal**
Master the 3D viewport and basic mesh manipulation to create a simple low-poly object.

### **Tasks**
1. **Viewport Mastery**: Navigate using `MMB` (Rotate), `Shift + MMB` (Pan), and `Scroll` (Zoom).
2. **Object vs Edit Mode**: Use `Tab` to switch between modes.
3. **Selection**: Practice Vertex (`1`), Edge (`2`), and Face (`3`) selection modes.
4. **The Big Three**: Use `G` (Grab/Move), `R` (Rotate), and `S` (Scale) along specific axes (e.g., `G` then `Z`).
5. **Creation**: Delete the default cube (`X`) and add a Plane (`Shift + A`).

### **Practice Drill**
Create a basic 4-legged stool using only primitive cubes and the Move/Scale tools. Ensure all legs are aligned on the floor grid.
