# Problem Set 06: Titles and Essential Graphics

### **Goal**
Create professional-looking titles and graphics directly in Premiere.

### **Tasks**
1. **Type Tool**: Create basic text on screen (`T`).
2. **Essential Graphics Panel**: Adjust font, size, tracking, and alignment.
3. **MOGRTs**: Import and customize a Motion Graphics Template (.mogrt) from After Effects.
4. **Responsive Design**: Use "Pin to" features to ensure your graphics scale correctly with different frame sizes.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a "Lower Third" for an interview subject. It should include their name in bold and their job title in a smaller, lighter font. Add a simple rectangular background shape.
