# Problem Set 02: IP Addressing & Subnetting

### **Goal**
Learn how devices are identified on a network and how networks are partitioned.

### **Tasks**
1. **IPv4 vs IPv6**: Explain the limitations of IPv4 and how IPv6 solves them.
2. **Subnet Masks**: Calculate the number of available hosts in a `/24` and `/28` network.
3. **Public vs Private IP**: Explain NAT (Network Address Translation).
4. **DHCP**: Explain how a device automatically gets an IP address when it connects to a router.

### **Practice Drill**
Find your own local IP address and your public IP address. Explain why they are different.
