# Problem Set 03: File Systems

### **Goal**
Understand how the OS persists data on physical storage devices.

### **Tasks**
1. **Inodes**: Explain how Linux/Unix file systems store file metadata.
2. **Directories**: How are directories just special files that map names to Inodes?
3. **Journaling**: How does a journaling file system (like EXT4 or NTFS) recover from a crash?
4. **Hard vs. Soft Links**: Explain the difference and what happens when the original file is deleted.

### **Practice Drill**
Use the `stat` command on a file in Linux to see its Inode number and metadata.
