# Complexity Analysis (Big O)

Learn how to measure the efficiency of your code.

## The Problem
If you have two ways to solve a problem, which one is better? Is it the one that uses less memory, or the one that finishes faster?

## Key Concepts
1. **Time Complexity**: How the runtime grows as the input size ($n$) increases.
2. **Space Complexity**: How the memory usage grows.
3. **Common Notations**:
   - $O(1)$: Constant (fastest)
   - $O(\log n)$: Logarithmic (very fast)
   - $O(n)$: Linear (standard)
   - $O(n \log n)$: Linearithmic (sorting)
   - $O(n^2)$: Quadratic (slow)

## Exercise
1. Look at a nested loop and determine its Big O complexity.
2. Compare a linear search to a binary search.
