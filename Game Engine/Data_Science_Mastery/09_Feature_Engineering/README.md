# Problem Set 09: Feature Engineering

### **Goal**
Create better input data to improve model performance.

### **Tasks**
1. **Feature Selection**: Use Correlation Matrices to remove redundant features.
2. **Polynomial Features**: Create non-linear features from linear ones.
3. **Handling Skewness**: Use Log transformations on skewed numerical data.
4. **Domain Knowledge**: Why is adding a "Is_Weekend" feature useful for sales prediction?

### **Practice Drill**
Take a raw dataset and create 5 new "engineered" features that improve your model's R-squared.
