# Web Security

Protecting websites and their users.

## Concepts
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Injecting malicious scripts into a webpage.
- **SQL Injection**: Injecting malicious SQL queries into a database.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: Tricking a user into performing an action they didn't intend.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Proving who you are and what you're allowed to do.

## Challenge
1. Research the "OWASP Top 10" - the most critical web security risks.
2. Build a simple login form and research how to securely store passwords (using "Salting" and "Peppering").
3. Learn about "JWT" (JSON Web Tokens) and how they are used for stateless authentication.
