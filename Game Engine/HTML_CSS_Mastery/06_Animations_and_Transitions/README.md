# Problem Set 06: Animations and Transitions

### **Goal**
Bring your web pages to life with smooth motion.

### **Tasks**
1. **Transitions**: Animate a button's `background-color` and `transform` on hover.
2. **Keyframes**: Create a `@keyframes` animation that makes an element bounce.
3. **Animation Properties**: Use `animation-iteration-count: infinite` and `animation-timing-function: ease-in-out`.
4. **Performance**: Explain why animating `transform` and `opacity` is better for performance than `width` or `top`.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a loading spinner using only HTML and CSS.
