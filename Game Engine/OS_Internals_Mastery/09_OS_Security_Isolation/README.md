# Problem Set 09: OS Security & Isolation

### **Goal**
Learn how the OS prevents malicious programs from stealing data or crashing the system.

### **Tasks**
1. **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)**: How does it prevent buffer overflow attacks?
2. **DEP/NX Bit**: How does the OS prevent code from being executed in data-only memory regions?
3. **Capabilities & Permissions**: Explain the Linux `sudo` model vs. Android's app permission model.
4. **Sandboxing**: How do web browsers isolate each tab into its own restricted process?

### **Practice Drill**
Research the "Spectre" and "Meltdown" vulnerabilities. How did they bypass OS isolation at the hardware level?
