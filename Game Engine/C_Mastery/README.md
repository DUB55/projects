# C Mastery: Foundation for Game Engines

This folder contains a structured path to master the C programming language. Each directory is a "Problem Set" designed to build your skills from the ground up.

## Why C first?
C++ is essentially "C with Classes" (and a lot of other features). By mastering C first, you learn:
1.  **How memory works**: No garbage collector, no safety nets.
2.  **The "Metal"**: You understand what the computer is actually doing.
3.  **Stability**: C is the foundation of almost all modern operating systems and game engine cores.

## Recommended Order
1.  [01_Basics](./01_Basics/README.md) - Output, Variables, Math
2.  [02_ControlFlow](./02_ControlFlow/README.md) - Loops and Logic
3.  [03_Functions](./03_Functions/README.md) - Reusable Logic
4.  [04_ArraysStrings](./04_ArraysStrings/README.md) - Collections of Data
5.  [05_Pointers](./05_Pointers/README.md) - Memory Addresses (Crucial!)
6.  [06_Structs](./06_Structs/README.md) - Custom Data Types
7.  [07_DynamicMemory](./07_DynamicMemory/README.md) - Malloc and Free
8.  [08_FileIO](./08_FileIO/README.md) - Saving and Loading
9.  [09_DataStructures](./09_DataStructures/README.md) - Linked Lists
10. [10_FinalProject](./10_FinalProject/README.md) - Text Adventure Engine

## Getting Help
If you get stuck or don't understand something, read [HELP.md](./HELP.md).

## How to Practice
- Read the `README.md` in each folder.
- Create a `main.c` file.
- Try to solve the exercises without looking up the answers immediately.
- Compile using `gcc` (or `clang`).

Good luck! Once you finish these 5 sets, you'll be ready to start the C++ transition and build your first window.
