# Problem Set 1: JavaScript Basics

Welcome to JavaScript! Unlike C, you can run JS directly in your browser or using Node.js.

## Concepts Covered
- **Variables**: `const` and `let`.
- **Data Types**: String, Number, Boolean, Array, Object.
- **Console**: `console.log()`.
- **Template Literals**: Using backticks `` ` `` for strings.

## The Exercises

### 1. The Greeting
Create a script that stores your name and age in variables. Print a message like "Hello, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old" using a template literal.

### 2. Basic Math
Create two numbers. Log their sum, difference, product, and the remainder (modulo).

### 3. The Array Explorer
Create an array of your 3 favorite games. 
1. Add a 4th game to the end.
2. Remove the 1st game.
3. Print the final array and its length.

## How to run this
1. Create an `index.html` file and link this script: `<script src="main.js"></script>`.
2. Open the HTML file in your browser and check the **Console** (F12).
