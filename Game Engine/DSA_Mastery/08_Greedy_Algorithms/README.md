# Problem Set 08: Greedy Algorithms

### **Goal**
Solve optimization problems by making the locally optimal choice at each step.

### **Tasks**
1. **Activity Selection**: Find the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.
2. **Huffman Coding**: Use a greedy approach to compress data by building a frequency tree.
3. **Coin Change (Greedy)**: Understand when a greedy approach works for making change and when it fails.
4. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Use a greedy approach with a priority queue to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.

### **Practice Drill**
Implement a "Fractional Knapsack" solver where you can take pieces of items to maximize the total value.
