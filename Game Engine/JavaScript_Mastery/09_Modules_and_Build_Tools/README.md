# Problem Set 09: Modules and Build Tools

### **Goal**
Organize code into modules and understand the build process.

### **Tasks**
1. **ES Modules**: Use `export` and `import` to share code between files.
2. **Default Exports**: Understand the difference between named and default exports.
3. **NPM Basics**: Initialize a project with `npm init` and install a package.
4. **Vite/Webpack**: Set up a simple project using a modern bundler like Vite.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a small utility library with several math functions in different files and import them into a main `index.js`.
