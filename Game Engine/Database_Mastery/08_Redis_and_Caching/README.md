# Problem Set 08: Redis and Caching

### **Goal**
Speed up applications using in-memory data stores.

### **Tasks**
1. **Key-Value Pairs**: Basic Redis commands: `SET`, `GET`, `EXPIRE`.
2. **Data Types**: Explain Redis Lists, Sets, and Sorted Sets.
3. **Caching Strategies**: Differentiate between "Cache-Aside", "Read-Through", and "Write-Through".
4. **Persistence**: How does Redis save data to disk (RDB vs AOF)?

### **Practice Drill**
Implement a "Rate Limiter" using Redis that limits a user to 10 requests per minute.
