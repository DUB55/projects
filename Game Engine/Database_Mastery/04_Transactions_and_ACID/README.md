# Problem Set 04: Transactions and ACID

### **Goal**
Ensure data integrity using transactions.

### **Tasks**
1. **ACID Properties**: Explain Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
2. **Transaction Isolation Levels**: Differentiate between Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable.
3. **Deadlocks**: How does a database detect and resolve a deadlock?
4. **Savepoints**: Use savepoints to partially roll back a transaction.

### **Practice Drill**
Write a SQL script that transfers money between two accounts ensuring that either both accounts are updated or neither is.
