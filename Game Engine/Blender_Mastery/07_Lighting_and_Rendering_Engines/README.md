# Problem Set 07: Lighting and Rendering Engines

### **Goal**
Master lighting techniques and understand the differences between Eevee and Cycles.

### **Tasks**
1. **Light Types**: Experiment with `Point`, `Sun`, `Spot`, and `Area` lights.
2. **Three-Point Lighting**: Set up a Key, Fill, and Rim light for a character or object.
3. **HDRI**: Use an Environment Texture (`World` properties) to light your scene with an image.
4. **Eevee vs Cycles**: Compare the look and render time of the same scene in both engines.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a "Cinematic Product Shot" of your stool or crate. Use a dark background, a strong rim light, and a soft fill light. Render it in Cycles with `Denoising` enabled.
