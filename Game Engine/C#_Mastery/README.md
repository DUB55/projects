# C# Mastery: The Engine of Unity

C# (pronounced "C Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. It is the primary language for Unity, one of the most popular game engines in the world.

## Why C#?
1. **Unity Engine**: The industry standard for indie and mobile games.
2. **Modern Syntax**: Combines the power of C++ with the ease of use of Java.
3. **Strong Tooling**: Excellent integration with Visual Studio and .NET.

## Note for Game Engine Developers
If you want to build games professionally today, C# is almost mandatory due to Unity's market share. Even if you build your own engine in C++, you might use C# for the editor or as a scripting language.
