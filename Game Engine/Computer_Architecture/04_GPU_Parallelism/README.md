# Problem Set 04: GPU Parallelism

### **Goal**
Understand the architectural differences between a CPU and a GPU.

### **Tasks**
1. **Latency vs Throughput**: Why is a CPU optimized for latency and a GPU for throughput?
2. **SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Threads)**: Explain how a GPU runs the same code on thousands of data points.
3. **Compute Units/SMs**: Research how cores are organized in an NVIDIA or AMD GPU.
4. **VRAM**: Why does a GPU need its own high-speed memory?

### **Practice Drill**
Compare the number of cores in a high-end CPU (e.g., Intel i9) with a high-end GPU (e.g., RTX 4090).
