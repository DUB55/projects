# System Design Mastery: Architecting the Engine

This module is designed to help you answer the big questions about building large-scale software. By the end of this curriculum, you will be able to confidently answer:

1. **Should I split my code into files or put it in one big file?**
2. **Is my system safe from crashes, memory leaks, and security threats?**
3. **How can I improve the UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface)?**
4. **How do I make my application load and run significantly faster?**

## The Curriculum Goals
Each problem set contains challenges that force you to experience the problems firsthand and implement the professional solutions.

## Problem Sets
1. [01_Modular_vs_Monolithic](./01_Modular_vs_Monolithic/README.md) - The "Big File" vs. "Small Files" debate.
