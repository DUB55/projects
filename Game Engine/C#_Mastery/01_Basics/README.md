# Problem Set 1: C# Basics

C# is the language of the .NET ecosystem and the primary language for Unity development.

## Concepts Covered
- **Console I/O**: `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.ReadLine()`.
- **Variables**: `int`, `string`, `bool`, `float`.
- **The `var` Keyword**: Implicitly typed variables.
- **String Interpolation**: Using `$"{variable}"`.

## The Exercises

### 1. The Welcome Script
Create a program that asks for the user's name and age. Print a message like: "Welcome [name], next year you will be [age + 1] years old!"

### 2. Number Cruncher
Take two floating-point numbers from the user. Print the result of adding, subtracting, and multiplying them. Use `double` for higher precision.

### 3. The Boolean Logic
Ask the user "Is it raining? (true/false)". Store the answer in a `bool` and print a message based on the result.

## Tip
In C#, every statement must end with a semicolon `;`, and your code must be inside a `class` and a `Main` method (unless using top-level statements in modern C#).
