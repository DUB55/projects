# Help: After Effects Mastery

## Common Issues
- **Preview is slow/laggy**: Lower the preview resolution (Full -> Half/Quarter) in the Composition panel. Purge your RAM cache (`Edit` -> `Purge` -> `All Memory & Disk Cache`).
- **Layers are missing**: Check if the layer's "Eye" icon is turned off or if it's hidden by a layer above it.
- **My keyframes aren't working**: Ensure the stopwatch icon is blue. If it's grey, you aren't recording changes.
- **Render is taking forever**: Check if you have heavy effects (like `Motion Tile` or `Camera Lens Blur`) enabled. Consider using `Adobe Media Encoder` for background rendering.
