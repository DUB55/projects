# Problem Set 06: Stored Procedures and Triggers

### **Goal**
Automate database tasks using server-side logic.

### **Tasks**
1. **Stored Procedures**: Write a procedure that calculates the total sales for a specific month.
2. **Triggers**: Create a trigger that logs every change made to a "Prices" table into an "Audit" table.
3. **Functions vs Procedures**: Explain when to use a User-Defined Function (UDF) instead of a procedure.
4. **Security**: How do stored procedures help prevent SQL Injection?

### **Practice Drill**
Implement an "Auto-Inventory" system where selling an item automatically decrements the stock count using a trigger.
