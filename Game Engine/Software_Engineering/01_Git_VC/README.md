# Git and Version Control

The "Time Machine" for your code.

## Concepts
- **Commits**: Saving a snapshot of your work.
- **Branches**: Working on new features without breaking the main code.
- **Merging and Rebasing**: Combining different versions of your code.
- **Remote Repositories**: Using GitHub or GitLab to collaborate.

## Challenge
1. Initialize a new Git repository and make your first commit.
2. Create a new branch, make a change, and merge it back into the main branch.
3. Research what a "Merge Conflict" is and how to resolve one.
