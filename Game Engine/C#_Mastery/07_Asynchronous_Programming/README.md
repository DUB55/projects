# Problem Set 07: Asynchronous Programming

### **Goal**
Master `async` and `await` to keep applications responsive.

### **Tasks**
1. **Async/Await**: Write a method that downloads a string from a URL asynchronously.
2. **Task.WhenAll**: Run three tasks in parallel and wait for all of them to finish.
3. **CancellationToken**: How do you stop a long-running task if the user cancels?
4. **Deadlocks**: Why should you never use `.Result` or `.Wait()` on an async task?

### **Practice Drill**
Simulate a "Cooking" app where you start the coffee, toast the bread, and fry an egg concurrently.
