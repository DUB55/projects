# Java Mastery: The Enterprise Powerhouse

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. "Write once, run anywhere."

## Why Java?
1. **Platform Independence**: Runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
2. **Minecraft**: One of the most famous games ever was built in Java.
3. **Enterprise Standard**: Used by massive corporations for stable, large-scale systems.

## Note for Game Engine Developers
While not as common as C++ or C# for high-end 3D engines, Java is excellent for 2D games and server-side engine components. Libraries like **libGDX** or **LWJGL** (which Minecraft uses) are very powerful.
