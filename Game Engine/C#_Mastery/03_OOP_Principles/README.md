# OOP Principles in C#

The foundation of .NET development.

## Concepts
- **Classes and Structs**: Understanding the difference between Reference and Value types.
- **Properties**: Using `get` and `set` (Auto-implemented properties).
- **Interfaces**: Defining a contract for your classes.
- **Generics**: Writing reusable code that works with any data type.

## Challenge
1. Create a `Generic Repository` class that can store any type of object.
2. Implement an interface `IDamageable` with a method `TakeDamage(int amount)`.
3. Apply this interface to both a `Player` class and an `Enemy` class.
