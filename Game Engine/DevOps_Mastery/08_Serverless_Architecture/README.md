# Problem Set 08: Serverless Architecture

### **Goal**
Build and deploy applications without managing servers.

### **Tasks**
1. **FaaS vs PaaS**: Explain the differences between Function-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service.
2. **AWS Lambda**: Write a simple Lambda function in Python that triggers on an S3 upload.
3. **API Gateway**: Set up an API Gateway to trigger a Lambda function via an HTTP request.
4. **Cold Starts**: Explain what a "cold start" is and how to mitigate it.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a serverless "Image Resizer" that automatically creates a thumbnail whenever an image is uploaded to an S3 bucket.
