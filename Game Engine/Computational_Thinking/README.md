# Computational Thinking: Logic & Problem Solving

Programming is 10% typing and 90% thinking. This folder is dedicated to the **mental frameworks** required to solve complex problems, regardless of which programming language you use.

## The Four Pillars
1. **Decomposition**: Breaking a large problem into smaller, manageable parts.
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Finding similarities between problems.
3. **Abstraction**: Focusing on the important details while ignoring the irrelevant ones.
4. **Algorithmic Thinking**: Developing a step-by-step solution.

## Recommended Path

2. [Stage 2: Boolean Logic](./Stage_02_Logic_Booleans/README.md) - Thinking in True/False.
3. [Stage 3: Algorithmic Design](./Stage_03_Algorithmic_Design/README.md) - Step-by-step plans.
4. [Stage 4: Data Modeling](./Stage_04_Data_Modeling/README.md) - How to represent the world.
5. [Stage 5: Optimization](./Stage_05_Optimization/README.md) - Making it faster.
