# Network Security

Protecting the pipes that carry our data.

## Concepts
- **Firewalls**: Blocking unauthorized traffic based on rules.
- **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**: Creating a secure tunnel through the internet.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitoring for suspicious activity.
- **Scanning and Enumeration**: Finding open ports and services (e.g., using `nmap`).

## Challenge
1. Use `nmap` to scan your own local machine for open ports (be careful and only scan devices you own!).
2. Research what a "Man-in-the-Middle" (MitM) attack is and how HTTPS prevents it.
3. Learn about the "OSI Model" and how security is applied at each layer.
