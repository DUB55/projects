# Cryptography

The art of secret writing and data protection.

## Concepts
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Using the same key to encrypt and decrypt (e.g., AES).
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Using a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt (e.g., RSA).
- **Hashing**: Creating a unique "fingerprint" for data (e.g., SHA-256).
- **Digital Signatures**: Proving that a message hasn't been tampered with.

## Challenge
1. Write a Python script that encrypts a message using a "Caesar Cipher" (The simplest form of encryption).
2. Research the difference between "Hashing" and "Encryption".
3. Use a library like `cryptography` in Python to encrypt a file using AES.
