# Problem Set 07: Classification and Clustering

### **Goal**
Group data and predict categories.

### **Tasks**
1. **Logistic Regression**: Use it for binary classification (e.g., Spam vs Not Spam).
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classify a point based on its neighbors.
3. **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised learning to group similar data points together.
4. **Confusion Matrix**: Calculate Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

### **Practice Drill**
Cluster "Customer Data" into segments based on spending habits and age.
