# Problem Set 09: Motion Tracking and Stabilization

### **Goal**
Attach digital elements to real-world footage.

### **Tasks**
1. **Point Tracker**: Use the `Tracker` panel to track a single point in a video.
2. **Null Objects**: Apply tracking data to a Null Object to use as a parent for other layers.
3. **Warp Stabilizer**: Use the `Warp Stabilizer` effect to smooth out shaky footage.
4. **3D Camera Tracker**: Use the `3D Camera Tracker` to place 3D text into a video scene.

### **Practice Drill**
Track a moving person's head and attach a "floating name tag" or a "funny hat" (a PNG image) to it using a Null Object.
