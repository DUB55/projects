# Problem Set 10: Advanced Graphs

### **Goal**
Master complex graph algorithms used in networking and social analysis.

### **Tasks**
1. **Topological Sort**: Order nodes in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every edge `u -> v`, `u` comes before `v`.
2. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Implement Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm to connect all nodes with the minimum total edge weight.
3. **Strongly Connected Components (SCC)**: Use Tarjan's or Kosaraju's algorithm to find clusters of nodes that can all reach each other.
4. **Max Flow**: Research the Ford-Fulkerson method for finding the maximum flow in a network.

### **Practice Drill**
Implement Kruskal's Algorithm using a "Union-Find" data structure to find the MST of a weighted graph.
