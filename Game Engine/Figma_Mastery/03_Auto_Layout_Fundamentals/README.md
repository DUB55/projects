# Problem Set 03: Auto Layout Fundamentals

### **Goal**
Create dynamic layouts that respond to content changes.

### **Tasks**
1. **Apply Auto Layout**: Select two layers and press `Shift + A`.
2. **Padding and Spacing**: Adjust the vertical/horizontal padding and the space between items.
3. **Alignment**: Change the alignment within the Auto Layout frame (e.g., top-left to center).
4. **Resizing**: Understand the difference between `Hug Contents`, `Fill Container`, and `Fixed Width`.

### **Practice Drill**
Build a "Button" component that grows or shrinks automatically based on the text you type inside it.
