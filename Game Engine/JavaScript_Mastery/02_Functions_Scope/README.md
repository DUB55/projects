# JavaScript Functions and Scope

The logic of your web applications.

## Concepts
- **Function Declarations vs Expressions**.
- **Arrow Functions**: The modern, concise syntax.
- **Scope**: Global vs Local (Function/Block scope).
- **Closures**: Functions that "remember" their environment.

## Challenge
1. Write a function that calculates the area of a circle.
2. Create a closure that increments a private counter.
3. Explain the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in terms of scope.
