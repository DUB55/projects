# Problem Set 1: C Basics

Welcome to your first step in mastering C! Before we build game engines, we need to understand how the language handles data and basic output.

## Concepts Covered
- **The Main Function**: Every C program starts here.
- **Pre-processor Directives**: `#include <stdio.h>` allows us to use standard input/output functions.
- **Variables & Data Types**: `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`.
- **printf()**: Printing formatted text to the console.

## The Exercises

### 1. Hello World
Create a program that prints "Hello, C Mastery!" to the console.

### 2. Variable Practice
Declare an integer for your age, a float for your height, and a character for your initial. Print them all in one sentence using format specifiers like `%d`, `%f`, and `%c`.

### 3. Basic Arithmetic
Ask for two numbers (use `scanf`) and print their sum, difference, and product.

## Compilation Tip
To compile your C code, use:
```bash
gcc main.c -o program
./program
```
