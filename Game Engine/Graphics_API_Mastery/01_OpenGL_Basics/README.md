# OpenGL Basics

The industry standard for cross-language, cross-platform graphics.

## Concepts
- **The Graphics Pipeline**: How data goes from your CPU to pixels on the screen.
- **Buffers and Arrays**: VBOs (Vertex Buffer Objects) and VAOs (Vertex Array Objects).
- **Coordinate Systems**: Local space, World space, View space, and Clip space.
- **Rendering a Triangle**: The "Hello World" of graphics programming.

## Challenge
1. Research what a "Context" is in OpenGL (e.g., GLFW or SDL2 context).
2. Draw a simple 2D triangle using a basic shader.
3. Research the difference between "Immediate Mode" (old) and "Core Profile" (modern) OpenGL.
