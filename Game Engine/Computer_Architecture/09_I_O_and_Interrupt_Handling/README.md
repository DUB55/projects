# Problem Set 09: I/O and Interrupt Handling

### **Goal**
Learn how the CPU communicates with the outside world.

### **Tasks**
1. **Programmed I/O vs DMA**: Why is Direct Memory Access (DMA) better for large file transfers?
2. **Polling vs Interrupts**: Compare checking a status register vs waiting for a signal.
3. **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**: What steps does the CPU take when an interrupt occurs?
4. **Buses**: Explain the roles of the Address Bus, Data Bus, and Control Bus.

### **Practice Drill**
Simulate an interrupt: Write a pseudocode handler that saves state, processes the event, and restores state.
