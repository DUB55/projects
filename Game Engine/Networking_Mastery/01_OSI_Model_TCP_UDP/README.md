# Problem Set 01: OSI Model & TCP/UDP

### **Goal**
Understand the theoretical layers of networking and the difference between reliable and unreliable transport.

### **Tasks**
1. **OSI Layers**: Memorize and explain the 7 layers of the OSI model.
2. **Encapsulation**: Explain how data is wrapped in headers as it moves down the layers.
3. **TCP vs UDP**: List 3 pros and cons for each.
4. **Port Numbers**: Identify common ports (80, 443, 22, 53, 3000).

### **Practice Drill**
Research why a competitive online game would use UDP instead of TCP for player movement, but TCP for the in-game store.
