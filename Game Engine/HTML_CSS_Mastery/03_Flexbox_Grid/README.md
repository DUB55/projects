# Modern Layouts: Flexbox and Grid

Designing complex structures with ease.

## Flexbox (1D Layout)
- Best for rows OR columns.
- `justify-content` and `align-items`.

## Grid (2D Layout)
- Best for rows AND columns simultaneously.
- `grid-template-columns` and `grid-gap`.

## Challenge
1. Build a Navigation Bar using Flexbox (Logo on the left, links on the right).
2. Build a 3-column "Pricing Table" using CSS Grid.
3. Research when to use Flexbox vs when to use Grid.
