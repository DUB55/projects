# Problem Set 01: Binary Logic & Gates

### **Goal**
Master the fundamental logic that all computers are built upon.

### **Tasks**
1. **Logic Gates**: Draw the truth tables for `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `XOR`, and `NAND`.
2. **NAND Universality**: Prove that you can build any other gate using only `NAND` gates.
3. **Adders**: Build a "Half Adder" and a "Full Adder" using logic gates.
4. **ALU**: Explain the role of the Arithmetic Logic Unit in a CPU.

### **Practice Drill**
Use a tool like `Logisim` to build a 4-bit adder that can add two binary numbers together.
