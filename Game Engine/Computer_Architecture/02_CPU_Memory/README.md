# Problem Set 02: CPU & Memory Hierarchy

### **Goal**
Understand how the CPU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions, and where data is stored.

### **Tasks**
1. **The Von Neumann Architecture**: Explain the components: CPU, Memory, and I/O.
2. **The Fetch-Execute Cycle**: Describe the steps the CPU takes to run a single instruction.
3. **Memory Hierarchy**: Rank the following by speed and size: Registers, L1 Cache, L2 Cache, RAM, SSD.
4. **The Program Counter (PC)**: Explain its role in keeping track of which instruction to run next.

### **Practice Drill**
Research the "Clock Speed" of your own CPU. Calculate how many cycles it performs in one second.
