# Vulkan Architecture

The high-performance, low-overhead successor to OpenGL.

## Concepts
- **Explicit Control**: You control everything (memory, sync, queues).
- **Vulkan Instances and Physical Devices**: Querying GPU capabilities.
- **Command Buffers**: Recording operations to be executed on the GPU.
- **Render Passes and Pipelines**: Defining the rendering state upfront.

## Challenge
1. Research why Vulkan is considered "Verbose" compared to OpenGL.
2. Read about the "Validation Layers" in Vulkan and why they are essential for debugging.
3. Compare the performance of a simple Vulkan app vs an OpenGL app (High-level research).
