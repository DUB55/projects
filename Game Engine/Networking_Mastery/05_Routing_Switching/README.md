# Problem Set 05: Routing & Switching

### **Goal**
Learn how data packets are physically moved between networks.

### **Tasks**
1. **Switching**: Explain MAC addresses and how a switch uses an ARP table.
2. **Routing**: Explain how a router decides which path a packet should take (BGP, OSPF).
3. **Gateway**: What is a "Default Gateway"?
4. **Traceroute**: Use the `tracert` (Windows) or `traceroute` (Linux) command to see the path to a website.

### **Practice Drill**
Run `tracert 8.8.8.8` and identify which hops are inside your home network and which are outside.
