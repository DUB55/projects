# Problem Set 07: 3D Layers and Cameras

### **Goal**
Move into 3D space and control the viewer's perspective.

### **Tasks**
1. **3D Switch**: Turn on the 3D cube icon for a layer.
2. **Cameras**: Add a `One-Node` or `Two-Node` Camera (`Ctrl + Alt + Shift + C`).
3. **Camera Tools**: Use `C` to cycle through Orbit, Pan, and Dolly tools.
4. **Depth of Field**: Enable `Depth of Field` in the Camera Options and adjust the `Aperture` and `Focus Distance`.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a "3D Tunnel" effect. Place multiple copies of a shape layer at different positions along the Z-axis. Animate a camera flying through the center of them.
