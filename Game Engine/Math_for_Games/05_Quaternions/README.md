# Quaternions

Smooth 3D rotations without the headache.

## Concepts
- **The Problem with Euler Angles**: Gimbal Lock (losing a degree of freedom).
- **Complex Numbers**: Quaternions as an extension of complex numbers.
- **Slerp (Spherical Linear Interpolation)**: Smoothly rotating from one orientation to another.
- **Rotation Vectors**: The axis-angle representation.

## Challenge
1. Research what "Gimbal Lock" is and find a video demonstrating it.
2. Read about why almost all 3D game engines (Unity, Unreal, Godot) use Quaternions internally.
3. Learn how to convert a Quaternion back into a Matrix for the GPU to use.
