# Problem Set 02: Timeline Editing Tools

### **Goal**
Master the keyboard shortcuts and tools that make editing fast.

### **Tasks**
1. **Selection Tool**: `V` for basic moving.
2. **Ripple Edit**: `B` to adjust a clip's length without leaving a gap.
3. **Razor Tool**: `C` to cut clips.
4. **Slip and Slide**: `Y` and `U` to change the content of a clip without moving its position on the timeline.
5. **Shortcuts**: Use `Q` and `W` for Ripple Trim (extremely fast editing!).

### **Practice Drill**
Take a 2-minute raw interview and "cut the fluff". Remove all "umms", "ahhs", and long pauses using only `Q`, `W`, and `C`.
