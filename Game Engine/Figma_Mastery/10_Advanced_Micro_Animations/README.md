# Problem Set 10: Advanced Micro-Animations

### **Goal**
Create high-end, smooth UI motion using Smart Animate.

### **Tasks**
1. **Component Sets**: Create a component set with multiple variants (e.g., Default, Hover, Pressed).
2. **Interactive Components**: Prototype the transitions *inside* the component set so they work automatically in any design.
3. **Smart Animate Layers**: Ensure layer names and hierarchy match exactly between two frames to get the best Smart Animate results.
4. **Easing Curves**: Experiment with custom cubic-bezier easing for more natural motion.

### **Practice Drill**
Create an "Animated Switch" or "Toggle". When clicked, the circle should slide smoothly to the other side and the background color should change, all using Smart Animate.
