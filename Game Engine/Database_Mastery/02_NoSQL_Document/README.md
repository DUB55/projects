# NoSQL and Document Databases

Speed and flexibility for modern apps.

## Types of NoSQL
- **Document (MongoDB)**: Stores data as JSON. Great for user profiles.
- **Key-Value (Redis)**: Ultra-fast. Used for caching and leaderboards.
- **Graph (Neo4j)**: Used for social networks.

## Challenge
1. Store a user profile object in a MongoDB collection.
2. Use Redis to store and retrieve a high-score value with a 10-second expiration.
