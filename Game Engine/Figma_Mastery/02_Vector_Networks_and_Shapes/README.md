# Problem Set 02: Vector Networks and Shapes

### **Goal**
Master Figma's unique vector engine for drawing icons and logos.

### **Tasks**
1. **Pen Tool**: Draw a simple "Heart" or "Star" shape using the Pen tool (`P`).
2. **Boolean Operations**: Take two circles and use `Union`, `Subtract`, `Intersect`, and `Exclude` to create new shapes.
3. **Corner Radius**: Adjust the corner radius of a rectangle to make it a "pill" shape.
4. **Strokes**: Add a stroke to a shape and change it from `Center` to `Inside` or `Outside`.

### **Practice Drill**
Recreate a popular app icon (like the Instagram or Spotify logo) using only basic shapes and Boolean operations.
