# Cross-Platform Development (React Native & Flutter)

Write once, run everywhere (mostly).

## Concepts
- **React Native**: Using JavaScript/React to build native mobile apps.
- **Flutter**: Using Dart and a custom rendering engine to build apps.
- **Hot Reload**: Seeing your changes instantly on the device.
- **Bridges vs. Direct Rendering**: How different frameworks talk to the OS.

## Challenge
1. Set up a basic React Native or Flutter project.
2. Build a "Weather App" UI that looks the same on both Android and iOS.
3. Research the pros and cons of Cross-Platform vs. Native development.
