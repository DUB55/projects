# Reinforcement Learning

Learning through trial and error, rewards and punishments.

## Concepts
- **Agent and Environment**: The "player" and the "world".
- **States and Actions**: What the agent sees and what it can do.
- **Rewards**: The feedback the agent gets for its actions.
- **Q-Learning**: A popular algorithm for finding the optimal policy.

## Challenge
1. Build a simple "Grid World" where an agent has to find the exit while avoiding traps.
2. Implement a basic Q-Learning algorithm to train the agent to find the fastest path.
3. Research how Reinforcement Learning is used in game AI (e.g., AlphaGo).
