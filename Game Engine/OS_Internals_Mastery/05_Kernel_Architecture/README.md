# Problem Set 05: Kernel Architecture

### **Goal**
Compare different ways of structuring an operating system.

### **Tasks**
1. **Monolithic Kernels**: Explain the architecture of Linux and Windows.
2. **Microkernels**: Research the Minix or L4 kernels. What are the benefits of isolation?
3. **Hybrid Kernels**: How does MacOS (XNU) combine both approaches?
4. **User Space vs. Kernel Space**: Why is the distinction important for security?

### **Practice Drill**
List 3 advantages and 3 disadvantages of a Microkernel architecture compared to a Monolithic one.
