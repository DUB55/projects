# Help: Premiere Pro Mastery

## Common Issues
- **"Media Pending" / Red Frames**: Premiere is struggling to find or link your files. Use `Window` -> `Workspaces` -> `Reset to Saved Layout` or restart the app.
- **Timeline is laggy**: Use `Proxies` (see Problem Set 09) or lower the playback resolution (Full -> 1/2 or 1/4) in the Program Monitor.
- **Audio is only in one ear**: Use the `Fill Left with Right` or `Fill Right with Left` effect.
- **Exported video looks washed out**: This is often a Gamma shift issue with QuickTime. Try exporting as H.264 (.MP4) with the `Match Source - High Bitrate` preset.
