# Problem Set 05: ISA and Assembly Drills

### **Goal**
Understand how high-level code translates to machine instructions.

### **Tasks**
1. **Instruction Types**: Differentiate between R-type, I-type, and J-type instructions in MIPS or x86.
2. **Registers vs Memory**: Why are registers faster? Write a pseudo-assembly snippet to move data from memory to a register and back.
3. **Assembly Translation**: Manually translate `x = y + 5` into assembly instructions.
4. **Tool**: Explore a simulator like MARS (for MIPS) or Godbolt (Compiler Explorer) to see how C++ compiles to assembly.

### **Practice Drill**
Write a loop in assembly that sums numbers from 1 to 10.
