# Problem Set 07: Multi-Camera Editing

### **Goal**
Efficiently edit footage from multiple cameras shooting the same scene.

### **Tasks**
1. **Syncing**: Sync multiple clips using `Audio` or `Timecode`.
2. **Multi-Cam Source Sequence**: Create a multi-cam sequence from your synced clips.
3. **Multi-Cam Monitor**: Enable the multi-cam view in the Program Monitor.
4. **Live Cutting**: Play the sequence and use number keys (`1`, `2`, `3`) to switch between cameras in real-time.

### **Practice Drill**
Sync a 3-camera musical performance or interview. Perform a "Live Cut" of the first 60 seconds, then go back and refine the cut points on the timeline.
