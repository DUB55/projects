# Ethical Hacking

Hacking for good.

## Concepts
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulating an attack to find vulnerabilities.
- **Bug Bounties**: Getting paid to find and report security flaws.
- **Social Engineering**: Tricking people into giving away information.
- **Reporting and Remediation**: Documenting findings and helping to fix them.

## Challenge
1. Research what a "Certified Ethical Hacker" (CEH) is.
2. Sign up for a platform like "Hack The Box" or "TryHackMe" to practice in a legal and safe environment.
3. Read about the "Responsible Disclosure" policy and why it's important.
