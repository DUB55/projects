# Problem Set 09: Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

### **Goal**
Apply software engineering principles to operations to create scalable and highly reliable software systems.

### **Tasks**
1. **SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs**: Define each and explain how they relate to the "Error Budget".
2. **Incident Management**: Describe the steps to take during a "Sev 1" production outage.
3. **Chaos Engineering**: Explain the concept and how tools like Chaos Monkey work.
4. **Automation**: Identify a manual task ("toil") and write a script to automate it.

### **Practice Drill**
Simulate a "High Latency" event on a local web server and use monitoring tools to detect and alert on the breach of an SLO.
