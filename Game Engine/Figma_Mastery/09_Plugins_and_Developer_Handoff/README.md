# Problem Set 09: Plugins and Developer Handoff

### **Goal**
Speed up your workflow and prepare your designs for engineering.

### **Tasks**
1. **Plugins**: Install and use a plugin like `Unsplash` (for images), `Iconify` (for icons), or `Stark` (for accessibility).
2. **Dev Mode**: Switch to "Dev Mode" to see the CSS/Swift/Kotlin code for your layers.
3. **Exporting Assets**: Mark layers as "Export" and choose formats like PNG, SVG, or PDF.
4. **Commenting**: Use the `Comment` tool (`C`) to leave feedback on a design.

### **Practice Drill**
Prepare a single screen for handoff. Ensure all icons are exported as SVGs, all images are named correctly, and use the Dev Mode to copy the CSS for a specific button.
