# Problem Set 01: Composition Basics

### **Goal**
Understand the core structure of an After Effects project.

### **Tasks**
1. **Create a Composition**: `Ctrl + N`. Set it to 1920x1080, 24fps, 10 seconds.
2. **Import Assets**: Import a still image and a video file (`Ctrl + I`).
3. **Layer Management**: Stack layers in the timeline. Understand how top layers obscure bottom layers.
4. **Transform Properties**: Explore `Anchor Point` (`A`), `Position` (`P`), `Scale` (`S`), `Rotation` (`R`), and `Opacity` (`T`).

### **Practice Drill**
Create a simple "Slide Show". Place 3 images in a composition. Scale them up slowly over 3 seconds each and use Opacity to fade between them.
