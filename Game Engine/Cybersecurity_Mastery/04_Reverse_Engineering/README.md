# Reverse Engineering

Taking things apart to see how they work.

## Concepts
- **Assembly Language**: The low-level language that the CPU speaks.
- **Disassemblers and Decompilers**: Tools like `Ghidra` or `IDA Pro`.
- **Static vs. Dynamic Analysis**: Examining code without running it vs. running it in a debugger.
- **Malware Analysis**: Understanding what a malicious program does.

## Challenge
1. Write a simple "Hello World" program in C and compile it.
2. Use a tool like `objdump` or a disassembler to look at the assembly code generated by the compiler.
3. Try to find where the "Hello World" string is stored in the binary.
