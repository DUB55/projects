# Java Control Flow

Deciding what your program does next.

## Concepts
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `else if`, `else`.
- **Switch Statements**: A cleaner way to check multiple values.
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- **Enhanced For Loop**: Iterating over arrays and collections easily.

## Challenge
1. Write a program that prints numbers 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3 print "Fizz" and for multiples of 5 print "Buzz". (The classic FizzBuzz).
2. Use a `switch` statement to print the name of the month based on a number (1-12).
