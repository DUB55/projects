# Linear Data Structures

How to organize data in a line.

## Modules
1. **Arrays**: Fixed size, fast access by index ($O(1)$).
2. **Linked Lists**: Dynamic size, fast insertion/deletion.
3. **Stacks**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). Think of a stack of plates.
4. **Queues**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO). Think of a line at a store.

## Challenge
1. Implement a Singly Linked List from scratch in C or Python.
2. Solve the "Valid Parentheses" problem using a Stack.
