# C++ Mastery: Building the Engine Logic

Welcome to the C++ portion of your journey. While C taught you how the hardware works, C++ will teach you how to manage complexity. This is the language of professional game development.

## Why C++ for Game Engines?
1.  **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: You can write high-level, organized code (OOP) that runs just as fast as low-level C.
2.  **The Standard Library**: Powerful tools for data structures and algorithms are built-in.
3.  **Industry Standard**: Unreal Engine, Frostbite, and Godot are all built with C++.

## Getting Help
If you get stuck, refer to the [HELP.md](./HELP.md) in this folder.

## Preparation
Ensure you have a modern C++ compiler (supporting at least C++17). If you followed the C path, your `gcc` or `clang` compiler already supports C++. Just use `g++` instead of `gcc`.
