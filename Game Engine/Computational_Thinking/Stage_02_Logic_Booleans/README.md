# Stage 2: Logical Thinking (Booleans & Conditions)

Computers only understand `0` and `1`. Everything you do in programming is built on top of Boolean Logic.

## Concepts Covered
- **AND / OR / NOT**: The fundamental gates.
- **Truth Tables**: Predicting outcomes.
- **Short-circuiting**: Why `if (A && B)` is efficient.

## Exercises

### 1. The Light Switch Problem
You have 3 switches outside a closed door. One switch controls a light bulb inside the room. You can only enter the room once. How do you find out which switch controls the bulb?
- *Hint*: Use more than just your eyes (think about physics!).

### 2. Complex Conditionals
Translate these real-world scenarios into `IF` statements:
1. "I will go outside if it is not raining AND (I have an umbrella OR it is sunny)."
2. "The door will open if the player has the Gold Key OR (they have the Silver Key AND their level is above 10)."

### 3. The Logical Shortcut
Explain why in the expression `(false && function())`, the `function()` is never even called.
- *Goal*: Understand how computers save time using logic.
