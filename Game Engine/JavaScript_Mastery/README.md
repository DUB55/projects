# JavaScript Mastery: The Language of the Web

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it's most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js.

## Why JavaScript?
1. **The Language of the Web**: Every browser runs JS.
2. **Asynchronous by Design**: Perfect for things like networking and user interfaces.
3. **Versatile**: Used for frontend (React/Vue), backend (Node.js), and even game engines (Phaser, Three.js).

## Note for Game Engine Developers
JavaScript is often used for web-based games. Using libraries like **Three.js** (3D) or **PixiJS** (2D), you can build powerful game engines that run directly in any browser without installation.
