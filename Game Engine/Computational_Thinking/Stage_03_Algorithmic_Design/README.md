# Stage 3: Algorithmic Design

An algorithm is just a fancy word for a "recipe". It is a set of instructions that takes an input and produces an output.

## The Exercises

### 1. Sorting by Hand
Take a deck of cards (or a list of numbers). 
1. Describe how you would sort them from smallest to largest if you could only look at **two cards at a time**.
2. This is called a "Bubble Sort". Write down the steps.

### 2. Search Strategy
If I pick a number between 1 and 100, and you guess. I tell you "Higher" or "Lower".
- What is the most efficient way to find the number?
- How many guesses will it take at most?
- *Goal*: Discover "Binary Search".

### 3. The Pathfinding Logic
How would you tell a character to find its way out of a maze?
- *Rule*: You can only see the walls immediately around you.
- *Goal*: Understand the foundation of AI movement.
