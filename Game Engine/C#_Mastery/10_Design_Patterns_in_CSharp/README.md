# Problem Set 10: Design Patterns in C#

### **Goal**
Apply industry-standard patterns to solve common software design problems.

### **Tasks**
1. **Singleton**: Implement a thread-safe `Logger` singleton.
2. **Factory**: Create a `ShapeFactory` that returns `Circle` or `Square` based on input.
3. **Strategy**: Implement different sorting strategies that can be swapped at runtime.
4. **Observer**: Use C# `event` to implement the observer pattern between a `Subject` and multiple `Observers`.

### **Practice Drill**
Build a small "Game Engine" structure using a `Component` pattern or `State` pattern.
