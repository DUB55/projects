# Problem Set 08: Genetic Algorithms

### **Goal**
Use the principles of evolution (mutation, crossover, selection) to solve optimization problems.

### **Tasks**
1. **Population**: Initialize a random set of "individuals" (potential solutions).
2. **Fitness Function**: Define a mathematical way to score how "good" a solution is.
3. **Crossover**: Combine two high-scoring individuals to create "offspring".
4. **Mutation**: Introduce random changes to maintain diversity in the population.

### **Practice Drill**
Solve the "Traveling Salesperson Problem" (finding the shortest route between multiple cities) using a Genetic Algorithm.
