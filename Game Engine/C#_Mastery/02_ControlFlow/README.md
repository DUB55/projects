# C# Control Flow

Logic and decision making in C#.

## Concepts
- **Conditionals**: `if`, `else`, `switch` (with pattern matching).
- **Loops**: `for`, `foreach`, `while`.
- **Nullable Types**: Handling `null` safely with `?` and `??`.

## Challenge
1. Write a `foreach` loop that iterates through a list of integers and prints only the prime numbers.
2. Use the "null-coalescing" operator (`??`) to provide a default value for a string that might be null.
