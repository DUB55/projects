# Problem Set 1: Python Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its readability. It's often called "executable pseudocode".

## Concepts Covered
- **Printing**: Using `print()`.
- **Variables**: No need to declare types (Dynamic Typing).
- **Data Types**: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`.
- **Input**: Using `input()`.

## The Exercises

### 1. Hello Python
Create a script that prints "Hello, Python Mastery!" and asks the user for their favorite hobby.

### 2. Simple Calculator
Ask for two numbers and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Note: Python's `/` always returns a float!

### 3. F-Strings
Create variables for a movie title, a release year, and a rating. Print a single sentence using an f-string (e.g., `f"The movie {title} was released in {year}"`).

## Comparison to C
In Python, you don't need `#include <stdio.h>` or `int main()`. You just start writing code!
