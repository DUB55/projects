# Problem Set 03: Audio Mixing and Cleanup

### **Goal**
Ensure your video sounds professional.

### **Tasks**
1. **Audio Gain**: Use `G` to normalize your clips to -3dB or -6dB.
2. **Essential Sound Panel**: Use the `Dialogue` preset to automatically clean up noise and improve clarity.
3. **Keyframing Volume**: Use the `Pen Tool` (`P`) to manually lower music volume when someone is speaking (Ducking).
4. **Effects**: Apply `Parametric Equalizer` and `Dynamics` to your master audio track.

### **Practice Drill**
Mix a scene with background music and a voiceover. Ensure the voice is always clear and the music "swells" during the moments of silence.
