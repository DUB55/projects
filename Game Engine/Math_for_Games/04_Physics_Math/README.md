# Physics Math

The math of motion and forces.

## Concepts
- **Kinematics**: Position, Velocity, and Acceleration.
- **Euler Integration**: The simplest way to update physics every frame.
- **Collisions**: AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) vs. Circle/Sphere collisions.
- **Impulse**: How forces change the velocity of an object instantly.

## Challenge
1. Write the code for a basic Euler integrator: `velocity += acceleration * dt; position += velocity * dt;`.
2. Implement an AABB collision check between two rectangles.
3. Research what "Delta Time" (`dt`) is and why it's critical for frame-independent physics.
