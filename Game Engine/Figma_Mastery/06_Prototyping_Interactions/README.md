# Problem Set 06: Prototyping Interactions

### **Goal**
Turn static designs into interactive flows.

### **Tasks**
1. **Connections**: Drag a blue arrow from one frame to another in `Prototype` mode.
2. **Triggers**: Set a transition to happen `On Click`, `On Hover`, or `After Delay`.
3. **Smart Animate**: Use `Smart Animate` to create smooth transitions between frames with matching layer names.
4. **Overlay**: Create a "Modal" or "Pop-up" that appears as an overlay.

### **Practice Drill**
Prototype a 3-screen app flow: Login -> Dashboard -> Profile. Ensure there is a way to navigate back to the previous screen.
