# Problem Set 05: Hashing and Maps

### **Goal**
Understand O(1) average-time complexity lookups using Hash Tables.

### **Tasks**
1. **Hash Functions**: Implement a basic hash function that converts a string into an integer index.
2. **Collision Handling**: Learn about `Chaining` (using linked lists) and `Open Addressing`.
3. **HashMap/Dictionary**: Practice using the built-in Map/Dictionary in your language of choice.
4. **Frequency Counting**: Use a hash map to count the occurrences of words in a large text.

### **Practice Drill**
Solve the "Two Sum" problem: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. (Aim for O(n) time).
