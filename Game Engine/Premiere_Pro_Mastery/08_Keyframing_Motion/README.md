# Problem Set 08: Keyframing Motion

### **Goal**
Add movement to your clips and graphics using keyframes.

### **Tasks**
1. **Position and Scale**: Animate a photo "zooming in" (the Ken Burns effect).
2. **Anchor Points**: Move the anchor point to change where an object rotates from.
3. **Temporal Interpolation**: Right-click keyframes to add `Ease In` and `Ease Out`.
4. **Spatial Interpolation**: Adjust the path of a moving object to be curved instead of linear.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a "Picture-in-Picture" effect. Take a second video track, scale it down to 30%, and animate it sliding in from the corner of the screen.
