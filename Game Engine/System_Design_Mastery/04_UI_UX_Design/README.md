# Problem Set: UI & UX Design

## The Question: How do I improve UX and UI?

User Experience (UX) is how it feels; User Interface (UI) is how it looks.

### Exercise 1: The Friction Audit
1. Design a menu where the user has to go through 4 different screens just to change the volume.
2. Now, design a "Quick Settings" overlay that does it in 1 click.
3. **The Discovery**: UX is about minimizing the number of steps to reach a goal.

### Exercise 2: Visual Hierarchy
1. Create a UI layout where every button is the same size, color, and font.
2. Now, make the "Play" button larger and bright green, while "Exit" is smaller and grey.
3. **The Discovery**: UI is about guiding the user's eyes to what matters most.

### Exercise 3: The Feedback Loop
1. Create a button that does nothing visually when clicked (but performs an action in the background).
2. Now, add a hover effect, a "click" sound, and a small animation.
3. **The Discovery**: Users feel more in control when the system acknowledges their actions.

## Final Answer
You will be able to answer that UX/UI is improved by:
- **Reducing Friction**: Fewer clicks = better experience.
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Use size and color to prioritize information.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Never let an action go unacknowledged.
