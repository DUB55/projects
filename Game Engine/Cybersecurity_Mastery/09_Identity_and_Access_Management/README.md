# Problem Set 09: Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### **Goal**
Control who can access what in your organization.

### **Tasks**
1. **Authentication vs Authorization**: Explain the difference between "Who are you?" and "What can you do?".
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Compare SMS, TOTP (Google Authenticator), and FIDO2 (YubiKey).
3. **OAuth 2.0 & OIDC**: Explain how "Sign in with Google" works without sharing your password.
4. **RBAC vs ABAC**: Compare Role-Based vs Attribute-Based Access Control.

### **Practice Drill**
Set up a simple Mock OAuth server or use a service like Auth0 to protect a "Secret" page in a web app.
