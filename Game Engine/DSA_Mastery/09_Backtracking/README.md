# Problem Set 09: Backtracking

### **Goal**
Explore all possible solutions and "backtrack" when a solution is invalid.

### **Tasks**
1. **Permutations**: Generate all possible arrangements of a list of numbers.
2. **Subsets**: Generate all possible subsets (the power set) of a set.
3. **N-Queens Problem**: Place N queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
4. **Sudoku Solver**: Use backtracking to fill a Sudoku grid.

### **Practice Drill**
Implement a "Maze Solver" that finds a path from the start to the end of a 2D grid using backtracking.
