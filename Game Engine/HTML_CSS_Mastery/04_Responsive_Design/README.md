# Responsive Design

Making your website look great on phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Concepts
- **Media Queries**: Applying CSS based on screen width.
- **Viewport Meta Tag**: Telling the browser how to scale the page.
- **Fluid Units**: Using `%`, `vw`, `vh`, and `rem` instead of fixed `px`.

## Challenge
1. Take the Pricing Table from the previous set.
2. Use a Media Query to stack the columns vertically when the screen is smaller than 600px.
3. Use a fluid font size that gets smaller on mobile.
