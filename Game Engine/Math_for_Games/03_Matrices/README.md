# Matrices and Transformations

Moving, Rotating, and Scaling objects in space.

## Concepts
- **Translation Matrix**: Moving an object.
- **Rotation Matrix**: Rotating an object around an axis.
- **Scaling Matrix**: Making an object bigger or smaller.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Combining multiple transformations into one.

## Challenge
1. Research what an "Identity Matrix" is and why it's the starting point for transformations.
2. Read about "Column-Major" vs "Row-Major" order in matrix memory.
3. Understand why matrix multiplication is NOT commutative (Order matters!).
