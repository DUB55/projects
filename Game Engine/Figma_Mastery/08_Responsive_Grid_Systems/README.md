# Problem Set 08: Responsive Grid Systems

### **Goal**
Design layouts that work on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### **Tasks**
1. **Layout Grids**: Apply a 12-column grid to a desktop frame and a 4-column grid to a mobile frame.
2. **Constraints**: Set layers to "Left & Right" or "Center" to control how they behave when a frame is resized.
3. **Breakpoints**: Create three versions of the same landing page for Desktop (1440px), Tablet (768px), and Mobile (375px).
4. **Auto Layout Wrapping**: Use the "Wrap" feature in Auto Layout to create a responsive photo gallery.

### **Practice Drill**
Design a "Navigation Bar" that stretches to fill the screen width on desktop but switches to a "Hamburger Menu" icon on mobile.
