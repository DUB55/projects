# Exception Handling in Java

Gracefully handling errors without crashing.

## Concepts
- **Try-Catch-Finally**: The basic block for error handling.
- **Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions**: Errors the compiler makes you handle vs those it doesn't.
- **Throw and Throws**: Manually triggering an exception.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Creating your own error types.

## Challenge
1. Write code that tries to divide by zero and catches the `ArithmeticException`.
2. Write a method that reads a file and uses `throws IOException` in its signature.
3. Research what "Try-with-resources" is and why it's better for closing files.
