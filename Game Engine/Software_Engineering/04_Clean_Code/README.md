# Clean Code and Documentation

Writing code that humans can understand.

## Principles
- **Meaningful Names**: Variables and functions should say what they do.
- **Functions should do ONE thing**: The "Single Responsibility Principle".
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Avoiding code duplication.
- **Comments vs. Code**: Code should be self-explanatory; comments are for the "Why", not the "How".

## Challenge
1. Take a piece of "Messy Code" (e.g., one with single-letter variables) and refactor it to be clean.
2. Research the "Boy Scout Rule" in software engineering.
3. Write a simple `README.md` for one of your small projects that explains how to install and run it.
