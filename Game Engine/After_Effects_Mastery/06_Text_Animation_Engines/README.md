# Problem Set 06: Text Animation Engines

### **Goal**
Animate typography using After Effects' powerful text animators.

### **Tasks**
1. **Source Text**: Learn how to change text content over time.
2. **Animators**: Add a `Position` or `Opacity` animator to a text layer.
3. **Range Selectors**: Use the `Start`, `End`, and `Offset` properties to animate characters one by one.
4. **Wiggly Selector**: Add organic, random motion to your text.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a "Typewriter" effect where letters appear one by one with a blinking cursor.
