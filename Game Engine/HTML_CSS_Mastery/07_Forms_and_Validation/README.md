# Problem Set 07: Forms and Validation

### **Goal**
Build accessible and functional user input forms.

### **Tasks**
1. **Input Types**: Use `email`, `password`, `number`, and `date` inputs.
2. **Labels**: Ensure every input has a correctly linked `<label>`.
3. **HTML5 Validation**: Use `required`, `minlength`, and `pattern` attributes.
4. **Pseudo-classes**: Style `:valid` and `:invalid` states of inputs.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a "Contact Us" form with validation that prevents submission if the email format is wrong.
