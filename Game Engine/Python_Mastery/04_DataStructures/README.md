# Problem Set 4: Python Data Structures

Python has extremely powerful built-in collections. You'll use these every day.

## Concepts Covered
- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable sequences. `[1, 2, 3]`.
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs. `{"name": "Alice"}`.
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable sequences. `(1, 2)`.
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items. `{1, 2}`.

## The Exercises

### 1. To-Do List
Create a program that uses a `list` to store tasks. Allow the user to add, remove, and view tasks.

### 2. Phonebook
Use a `dictionary` to store names and phone numbers. Allow the user to look up a number by entering a name.

### 3. List Comprehension
Create a list of numbers from 1 to 20. Use a **list comprehension** to create a new list containing only the squares of the even numbers.

## Why this matters
Python's dictionaries are highly optimized hash maps. In a game engine (if written in Python), you might use a dict to store all active game entities indexed by their unique ID.
