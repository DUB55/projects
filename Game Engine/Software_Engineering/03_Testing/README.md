# Software Testing

Ensuring your code actually works.

## Types of Tests
- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions or classes in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Testing how different parts of the system work together.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Testing the entire user journey.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing the test *before* you write the code.

## Challenge
1. Write a simple function (e.g., `add(a, b)`) and write a unit test for it using a framework like `Jest` (JS) or `pytest` (Python).
2. Research the "Testing Pyramid" and why unit tests should be the majority of your tests.
3. Try to use TDD to build a simple "String Reverser" function.
