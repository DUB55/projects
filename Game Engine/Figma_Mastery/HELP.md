# Help: Figma Mastery

## Common Issues
- **"Why is my layer hidden?"**: Check the Layers panel (left side). Layers at the bottom are visually behind layers at the top. Also check if the "Eye" icon is toggled off.
- **Auto Layout is confusing**: Think of Auto Layout as a container (like a box). It controls the spacing and alignment of everything inside it.
- **My prototype links aren't working**: Ensure you are in the `Prototype` tab (right side) and that you've connected a "Trigger" (like On Click) to a "Destination".
- **Figma is slow**: Clear your cache or close unused tabs. Large files with many images or complex vectors can slow down the browser-based version.
