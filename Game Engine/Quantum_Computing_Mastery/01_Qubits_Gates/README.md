# Qubits and Quantum Gates

The building blocks of quantum information.

## Concepts
- **Qubits**: The quantum version of a bit (can be 0, 1, or both simultaneously).
- **Superposition**: Being in multiple states at once.
- **Entanglement**: Two qubits being linked, no matter how far apart they are.
- **Quantum Gates**: Operations that change the state of a qubit (e.g., Hadamard gate, CNOT gate).

## Challenge
1. Research what a "Bloch Sphere" is and how it represents the state of a qubit.
2. Read about the "Hadamard Gate" and how it creates superposition.
3. Compare a classical AND gate with a quantum CNOT gate.
