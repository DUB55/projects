# Vectors

Direction and Magnitude.

## Concepts
- **Addition and Subtraction**: Moving objects and finding the distance between them.
- **Dot Product**: Finding the angle between two vectors (Essential for lighting and AI FOV).
- **Cross Product**: Finding a vector perpendicular to two others (Essential for 3D physics).
- **Normalization**: Converting a vector to a "Unit Vector" (Length of 1).

## Challenge
1. Calculate the distance between two 3D points: `A(1, 2, 3)` and `B(4, 5, 6)`.
2. Use the Dot Product to determine if an enemy is looking at the player.
3. Research why we "Normalize" vectors before using them for movement.
