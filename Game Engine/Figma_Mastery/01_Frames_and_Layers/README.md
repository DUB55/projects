# Problem Set 01: Frames and Layers

### **Goal**
Understand the core hierarchy and organization of a Figma file.

### **Tasks**
1. **Create a Frame**: Press `F` and choose a "Desktop" or "iPhone" preset.
2. **Layer Naming**: Create 5 shapes and name them clearly in the layers panel.
3. **Grouping vs. Framing**: Group three shapes (`Ctrl + G`) and then frame them (`Ctrl + Alt + G`). Observe the difference in the properties panel.
4. **Alignment**: Use the alignment tools (top right) to center a circle inside a square.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a simple "Business Card" layout. Use a frame for the card, a text layer for the name, and small shapes for social media icons.
