# Problem Set 01: Project Setup and Ingestion

### **Goal**
Organize a project from the start to avoid chaos later.

### **Tasks**
1. **New Project**: Create a new project and set your "Scratch Disks" to a fast SSD.
2. **Bins**: Create bins for `Footage`, `Audio`, `Music`, `Graphics`, and `Sequences`.
3. **Importing**: Use the `Media Browser` to import files (this is safer than dragging and dropping).
4. **Sequence Settings**: Create a sequence that matches your footage (e.g., 1080p, 23.976fps).

### **Practice Drill**
Import 10 clips from a recent shoot. Organize them into sub-folders by scene or camera, and create a "Master Sequence" for your edit.
