# Problem Set 08: WebSockets & Real-Time

### **Goal**
Master full-duplex communication for real-time apps like chat or games.

### **Tasks**
1. **HTTP Polling vs WebSockets**: Why are WebSockets better for real-time?
2. **The Upgrade Header**: How does an HTTP connection turn into a WebSocket?
3. **Socket.io**: Explore a library that simplifies real-time communication.
4. **Latency**: Measure the round-trip time (RTT) of a message sent over a WebSocket.

### **Practice Drill**
Build a "Real-Time Chat App" where multiple users can send and receive messages instantly.
