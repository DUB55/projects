# Problem Set 10: Export Settings and Codecs

### **Goal**
Master the technical side of delivering your video to different platforms.

### **Tasks**
1. **Export Window**: `Ctrl + M`.
2. **Format vs. Preset**: Understand that H.264 is a format, and "YouTube 1080p" is a preset.
3. **Bitrate**: Learn the difference between VBR (Variable Bitrate) and CBR (Constant Bitrate).
4. **Metadata**: Add a title and author to your video's metadata during export.

### **Practice Drill**
Export a 30-second sequence in three ways: 
1. High-quality master (ProRes 422).
2. Web-ready (H.264, 10Mbps).
3. Low-res preview (H.264, 2Mbps). 
Compare the file sizes and visual quality.
