# Problem Set 09: MLOps and Deployment

### **Goal**
Move from a script on your computer to a production-ready AI service.

### **Tasks**
1. **Model Export**: Save your trained model using Pickle or ONNX.
2. **API Wrapper**: Use Flask or FastAPI to create a web endpoint for your model.
3. **Containerization**: Wrap your AI service in a Docker container.
4. **Monitoring**: Track the performance and accuracy of your model after it is deployed.

### **Practice Drill**
Deploy your "Spam Filter" from Problem Set 07 as a local web API that accepts a JSON string and returns a prediction.
