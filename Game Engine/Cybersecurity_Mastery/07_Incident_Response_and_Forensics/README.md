# Problem Set 07: Incident Response and Forensics

### **Goal**
Learn how to react to a security breach and collect evidence.

### **Tasks**
1. **The IR Lifecycle**: List the steps: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned.
2. **Memory Forensics**: Use Volatility to analyze a RAM dump for suspicious processes.
3. **Log Analysis**: Use `grep` and `awk` to find failed login attempts in `/var/log/auth.log`.
4. **Disk Imaging**: Explain the importance of write-blockers and hash verification (MD5/SHA256).

### **Practice Drill**
Analyze a provided `.log` file and identify the IP address that performed a successful SSH login after multiple failures.
