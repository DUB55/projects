# Problem Set 04: Device Drivers

### **Goal**
Learn how the kernel communicates with hardware devices.

### **Tasks**
1. **Character vs. Block Devices**: Explain the difference (e.g., keyboard vs. hard drive).
2. **I/O Ports vs. Memory-Mapped I/O**: How does the CPU talk to hardware?
3. **Polling vs. Interrupts**: Which is more efficient and why?
4. **Loadable Kernel Modules (LKM)**: How can you add features to a kernel without rebooting?

### **Practice Drill**
Research how to write a "Hello World" kernel module for Linux using `insmod` and `rmmod`.
