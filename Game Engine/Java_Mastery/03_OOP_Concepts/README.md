# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

The core philosophy of Java development.

## The Four Pillars
1. **Encapsulation**: Using `private` fields and `public` getters/setters.
2. **Inheritance**: Creating a `Child` class that extends a `Parent` class.
3. **Polymorphism**: One interface, multiple implementations (Overloading and Overriding).
4. **Abstraction**: Using `abstract` classes and `interface` to hide complexity.

## Challenge
1. Create a class `Animal` with a method `makeSound()`.
2. Create sub-classes `Dog` and `Cat` that override `makeSound()`.
3. Create a list of `Animal` objects and make them all "speak" in a loop.
