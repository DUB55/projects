# Trigonometry in Games

Angles, circles, and waves.

## Concepts
- **Sine and Cosine**: The fundamental functions for oscillating movement and circular motion.
- **Degrees vs Radians**: Understanding why computers use radians (2π).
- **Atan2**: The "Magical" function to find the angle between two points.
- **FOV (Field of View)**: Using trig to calculate what the player can see.

## Challenge
1. Write a formula to move an object in a circle over time using `sin` and `cos`.
2. Calculate the angle between a player's position and the mouse cursor using `atan2`.
3. Research what "Polar Coordinates" are and how they differ from "Cartesian Coordinates".
