# Problem Set 05: Transitions and Effects

### **Goal**
Use transitions and effects to improve the flow and visual style of your edit.

### **Tasks**
1. **Video Transitions**: Apply a `Cross Dissolve` and a `Dip to Black`. Learn how to adjust their duration.
2. **Effect Controls**: Learn how to modify effect parameters (like `Directional Blur` or `Gaussian Blur`).
3. **Adjustment Layers**: Use an Adjustment Layer to apply an effect to multiple clips at once.
4. **Warp Stabilizer**: Smooth out shaky footage using the `Warp Stabilizer` effect.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a "Dreamy Sequence" using a series of slow-motion clips. Use Adjustment Layers with a slight blur and color tint, and use long Cross Dissolves between shots.
