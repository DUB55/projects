# Pathfinding (A*)

How an agent finds the shortest path through a grid or a graph.

## Concepts
- **G-Cost**: Distance from the start node.
- **H-Cost (Heuristic)**: Estimated distance to the end node.
- **F-Cost**: G + H (The total priority).
- **Open List**: Nodes to be evaluated.
- **Closed List**: Nodes already evaluated.

## Challenge
1. Research the difference between Dijkstra's algorithm and A*.
2. Implement a simple A* pathfinder in a 2D grid where some cells are obstacles.
