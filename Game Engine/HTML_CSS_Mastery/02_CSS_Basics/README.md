# CSS Basics

Styling your HTML structure.

## Concepts
- **Selectors**: How to target elements (Class, ID, Tag).
- **The Box Model**: Margin, Border, Padding, and Content.
- **Colors and Typography**: Hex, RGB, Fonts, and Line-height.
- **Positioning**: Static, Relative, Absolute, and Fixed.

## Challenge
1. Create a "Card" component with a title, image, and description.
2. Use the Box Model to give it proper spacing and a border.
3. Change the card's background color when you hover over it using the `:hover` pseudo-class.
