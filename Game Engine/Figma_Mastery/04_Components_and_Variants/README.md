# Problem Set 04: Components and Variants

### **Goal**
Build reusable elements that maintain consistency across your design.

### **Tasks**
1. **Create Component**: Select a layer and press `Ctrl + Alt + K`.
2. **Main vs. Instance**: Notice how changes to the "Main" component update all "Instances".
3. **Variants**: Create a "Primary" and "Secondary" button as variants of the same component.
4. **Properties**: Add a "Boolean" property (e.g., to show/hide an icon) and a "Text" property.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a "Card" component (with an image, title, and button). Create a variant for "Dark Mode" and another for "Mobile Size".
