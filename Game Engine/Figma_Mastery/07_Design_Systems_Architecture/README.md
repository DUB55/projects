# Problem Set 07: Design Systems Architecture

### **Goal**
Organize your file for professional-level collaboration.

### **Tasks**
1. **Pages**: Use pages to separate "Drafts", "Components", "Icons", and "Final Designs".
2. **Naming Conventions**: Use the `Category / Component / Variant` naming structure (e.g., `Buttons / Primary / Hover`).
3. **Libraries**: Publish your styles and components to a library (if you have a professional/education plan).
4. **Documentation**: Add descriptions to your components so other designers know how to use them.

### **Practice Drill**
Organize a messy design file into 4 distinct pages. Rename all components using the forward-slash (`/`) convention.
