# Cybersecurity Mastery: Protecting the Digital World

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. As a developer, understanding how systems are broken is the only way to build systems that stay fixed.

## Why Cybersecurity?
- **Protection**: Secure your game engine from cheats and unauthorized access.
- **Privacy**: Protect user data and credentials.
- **Integrity**: Ensure that the code running on the user's machine is the code you wrote.
