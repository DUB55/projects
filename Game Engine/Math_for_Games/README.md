# Math for Games: The Language of the Universe

Game development is essentially applied mathematics. If you want a character to jump, rotate, or shoot, you need math.

## Why Math?
- **3D Graphics**: Moving vertices in space requires linear algebra.
- **Physics**: Gravity, friction, and collisions require calculus and vectors.
- **Gameplay**: Calculating damage, FOV, and pathfinding requires trigonometry.

## Curriculum
1. [01_Trigonometry](./01_Trigonometry/README.md) - Circles, Angles, and Waves.
2. [02_Vectors](./02_Vectors/README.md) - Direction and Magnitude (The heart of game movement).
3. [03_Matrices](./03_Matrices/README.md) - Transformation, Rotation, and Scaling.
4. [04_Physics_Math](./04_Physics_Math/README.md) - Forces, Velocity, and Acceleration.
5. [05_Quaternions](./05_Quaternions/README.md) - Advanced 3D rotation (Avoiding Gimbal Lock).
