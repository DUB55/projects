# HTML & CSS Mastery: Building the Visual Web

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the **structure** of a website, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides the **styling** and layout. Together with JavaScript, they form the "holy trinity" of web development.

## Why HTML & CSS?
1. **The Foundation**: You cannot build for the web without them.
2. **Visual Feedback**: You see the results of your code immediately.
3. **Accessibility**: Learning to write semantic HTML makes the web better for everyone.

## Note for Game Engine Developers
Even if you build a game engine in C++, you might use HTML/CSS for the **User Interface (UI)**. Many modern games (like those using Coherent Gameface) actually use web technologies to render their menus and HUDs!
