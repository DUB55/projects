# Software Engineering: Building for Longevity

Writing code is easy; maintaining code is hard. Software Engineering is the art of building systems that can grow without breaking.

## Why this matters?
- **Collaboration**: You need Git to work with others.
- **Architecture**: Design Patterns prevent your game engine from becoming "Spaghetti Code".
- **Reliability**: Testing ensures that fixing one bug doesn't create ten more.
