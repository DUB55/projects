# Quantum Algorithms

Solving problems that are impossible for classical computers.

## Concepts
- **Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm**: The first example of a quantum algorithm being faster than a classical one.
- **Grover's Algorithm**: Searching an unsorted database in O(sqrt(N)) time.
- **Shor's Algorithm**: Factoring large numbers (the algorithm that threatens RSA encryption).
- **Quantum Supremacy**: The point where a quantum computer outperforms the best classical supercomputer.

## Challenge
1. Research how Shor's Algorithm could potentially break modern cryptography.
2. Read about "Grover's Algorithm" and why it's faster than a classical search.
