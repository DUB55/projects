# Problem Set 01: Process Management

### **Goal**
Understand how the OS switches between multiple running programs.

### **Tasks**
1. **Process vs. Thread**: Explain the difference in memory and resources.
2. **Context Switching**: Describe what happens when the CPU switches from one process to another.
3. **Scheduling Algorithms**: Compare `First-Come-First-Served`, `Shortest Job First`, and `Round Robin`.
4. **Zombie Processes**: What is a zombie process and how is it "reaped"?

### **Practice Drill**
Write a simple C program that uses `fork()` to create a child process. Have the parent and child print different messages.
