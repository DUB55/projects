# Problem Set 09: Proxy Workflows

### **Goal**
Edit high-resolution (4K/8K) footage smoothly on any machine.

### **Tasks**
1. **Create Proxies**: Right-click footage and select `Proxy` -> `Create Proxies`.
2. **Media Encoder**: Understand how Media Encoder handles the background conversion.
3. **Toggle Proxies**: Add the `Toggle Proxies` button to your Program Monitor.
4. **Proxy vs. Full Res**: See the performance difference when proxies are enabled.

### **Practice Drill**
Take a heavy 4K clip, create a low-res H.264 proxy for it, and practice toggling between the proxy and the original file while editing.
