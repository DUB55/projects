# HTML & CSS Help & Guidance

Building for the web is about understanding how elements flow on a page.

## 1. The Box Model
Every element in HTML is a box.
- **Content**: The text/image.
- **Padding**: Space inside the box (between content and border).
- **Border**: The edge of the box.
- **Margin**: Space outside the box (between this box and others).

## 2. CSS Specificity
If two CSS rules conflict, which one wins?
1. Inline styles (`style="..."`)
2. IDs (`#header`)
3. Classes (`.menu-item`)
4. Elements (`h1`, `p`)

## 3. Flexbox vs Grid
- **Flexbox**: Best for a single row or column of items.
- **Grid**: Best for full-page layouts with rows AND columns.

## 4. Debugging with Inspect Element
Right-click any element on a webpage and select **Inspect**. You can change CSS values in real-time to see how they look without refreshing your code!

## 5. Where to learn more
- **CSS-Tricks**: Especially their guides on Flexbox and Grid.
- **Kevin Powell (YouTube)**: The king of CSS tutorials.
- **FreeCodeCamp**: Great interactive lessons for HTML/CSS.

## 6. The Golden Rule
**Keep your HTML semantic.** Use `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and `<button>` instead of just `<div>` for everything. It makes your site better for screen readers and search engines (SEO).
