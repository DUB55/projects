# Problem Set 05: Database Design and Normalization

### **Goal**
Design efficient and non-redundant database schemas.

### **Tasks**
1. **Normalization Forms**: Explain 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF with examples.
2. **ER Diagrams**: Draw an Entity-Relationship diagram for a "Blog System" (Users, Posts, Comments).
3. **Primary vs Foreign Keys**: How do they enforce referential integrity?
4. **Denormalization**: When is it okay to violate normalization rules for performance?

### **Practice Drill**
Take a flat CSV file and design a normalized schema with at least 3 tables to store the data.
