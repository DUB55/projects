# Trees and Graphs

Representing complex relationships between data.

## Trees
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Efficient searching and sorting.
- **Heaps**: Used for priority queues.

## Graphs
- **Representations**: Adjacency Matrix vs. Adjacency List.
- **Traversals**:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS): Level by level.
  - Depth-First Search (DFS): Deep into one branch first.

## Challenge
1. Implement a Binary Search Tree and write a function to find the maximum depth.
2. Use BFS to find the shortest path in a grid.
