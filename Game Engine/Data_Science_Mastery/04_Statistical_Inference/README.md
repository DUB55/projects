### **Goal**
Make data-driven decisions using probability and statistics.

### **Tasks**
1. **Hypothesis Testing**: Explain p-values and the null hypothesis.
2. **A/B Testing**: Design an experiment to test if a new button color increases clicks.
3. **Confidence Intervals**: Calculate the 95% confidence interval for a mean.
4. **Distributions**: Differentiate between Normal, Binomial, and Poisson distributions.

### **Practice Drill**
Perform a T-test on two sets of data to see if their means are significantly different.
