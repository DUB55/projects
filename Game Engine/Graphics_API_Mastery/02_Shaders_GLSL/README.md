# Shaders and GLSL

Programming the GPU directly.

## Concepts
- **GLSL**: OpenGL Shading Language (C-like syntax).
- **Vertex Shaders**: Handling vertex positions and transformations.
- **Fragment Shaders**: Determining the color of each pixel.
- **Uniforms and Attributes**: Passing data from the CPU to the GPU.

## Challenge
1. Create a fragment shader that changes the color of a shape based on the time (passed as a uniform).
2. Experiment with "Gradient" effects by interpolating colors between vertices.
