# Problem Set 09: Keyframe Animation

### **Goal**
Bring your models to life using keyframes and the Graph Editor.

### **Tasks**
1. **Inserting Keyframes**: Use `I` to insert keyframes for Location, Rotation, and Scale.
2. **Timeline**: Navigate the timeline and adjust the playback range.
3. **Graph Editor**: Use the `Graph Editor` to adjust the interpolation (Ease In/Out) of your animations.
4. **Dope Sheet**: Use the `Dope Sheet` to move and scale groups of keyframes.

### **Practice Drill**
Animate a "Bouncing Ball". Focus on "Squash and Stretch" (scaling the ball as it hits the ground) and the timing of the bounces (faster at the start, slower as it loses energy).
