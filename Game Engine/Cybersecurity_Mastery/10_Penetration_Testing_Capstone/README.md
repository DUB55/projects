# Problem Set 10: Penetration Testing Capstone

### **Goal**
Perform a full, ethical attack on a target to find vulnerabilities.

### **Tasks**
1. **Reconnaissance**: Use `nmap` and `subfinder` to map out a target's attack surface.
2. **Exploitation**: Use Metasploit to exploit a known vulnerability in a controlled VM.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Once inside, find a way to become `root` or `Administrator`.
4. **Reporting**: Write a professional summary of the findings and how to fix them.

### **Practice Drill**
Complete a "Capture The Flag" (CTF) challenge on a platform like TryHackMe or HackTheBox.
