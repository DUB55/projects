# Help: Computer Architecture Mastery

## Common Issues
- **Binary Math is hard**: Practice converting between Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal. Most architectural bugs are off-by-one errors in binary.
- **Cache Misses**: If your code is slow but your algorithm is O(n), you likely have a cache locality problem. Check your memory access patterns.
- **Race Conditions in Hardware**: When working with DMA or multi-core systems, ensure you understand memory barriers and atomic operations.
- **Simulator Errors**: Use tools like `MARS` or `SPIM` for MIPS, and `Logisim` for logic gates. Ensure your settings match the architecture you are studying.
