# Problem Set 04: Sculpting Basics

### **Goal**
Get comfortable with digital sculpting brushes and dynamic topology.

### **Tasks**
1. **Sculpt Mode**: Switch to `Sculpt Mode`.
2. **Brushes**: Experiment with `Draw`, `Grab`, `Snake Hook`, and `Crease` brushes.
3. **Dyntopo**: Enable `Dynamic Topology` to add geometry only where you brush.
4. **Remesh**: Use the `Voxel Remesher` (`Ctrl + R`) to maintain a clean mesh while sculpting.

### **Practice Drill**
Sculpt a basic "Rock" or "Boulder". Focus on creating sharp edges with the `Crease` or `Flatten` brush and organic indentations with the `Draw` brush.
