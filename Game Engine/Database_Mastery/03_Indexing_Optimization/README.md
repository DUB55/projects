# Indexing and Optimization

Don't let your database become a bottleneck.

## Concepts
- **B-Trees**: How databases find data without scanning every row.
- **Explain Plan**: Seeing exactly how the database executes your query.
- **Normalization vs Denormalization**: Choosing between data accuracy and data speed.

## Challenge
1. Create a table with 100,000 rows.
2. Measure the time it takes to find a specific row without an index.
3. Add an index and measure the time again. (You should see a massive improvement).
