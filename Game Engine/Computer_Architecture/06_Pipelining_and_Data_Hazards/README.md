# Problem Set 06: Pipelining and Data Hazards

### **Goal**
Learn how CPUs execute multiple instructions simultaneously and the problems that arise.

### **Tasks**
1. **Pipeline Stages**: List the 5 classic stages: IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB.
2. **Structural Hazards**: What happens when two instructions need the same hardware resource at the same time?
3. **Data Hazards**: Explain "Read After Write" (RAW) and how forwarding solves it.
4. **Control Hazards**: How do branches (if/else) disrupt the pipeline?

### **Practice Drill**
Draw a pipeline diagram for 3 simple instructions showing how they overlap in time.
