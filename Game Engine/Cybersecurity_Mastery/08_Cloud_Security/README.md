# Problem Set 08: Cloud Security

### **Goal**
Secure infrastructure in AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

### **Tasks**
1. **Shared Responsibility Model**: Who is responsible for what in the cloud?
2. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Create a policy that follows the "Principle of Least Privilege".
3. **S3 Bucket Security**: Why are open S3 buckets a common source of data leaks?
4. **VPC & Security Groups**: Configure a virtual firewall to only allow traffic on port 443.

### **Practice Drill**
Research the "Capital One Hack" and explain how an SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) led to a massive data breach.
