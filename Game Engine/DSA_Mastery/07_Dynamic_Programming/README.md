# Problem Set 07: Dynamic Programming (DP)

### **Goal**
Solve complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems.

### **Tasks**
1. **Memoization (Top-Down)**: Solve the Fibonacci sequence using a cache to avoid redundant calculations.
2. **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**: Solve Fibonacci using an iterative table approach.
3. **Knapsack Problem**: Understand the classic 0/1 Knapsack problem and its DP solution.
4. **Longest Common Subsequence**: Find the longest sequence shared by two strings.

### **Practice Drill**
Solve the "Climbing Stairs" problem: You can take 1 or 2 steps at a time. How many distinct ways can you reach the top of a staircase with N steps?
