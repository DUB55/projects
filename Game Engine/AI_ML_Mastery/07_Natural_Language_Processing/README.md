# Problem Set 07: Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### **Goal**
Teach machines to understand and generate human language.

### **Tasks**
1. **Tokenization**: Break a sentence into individual words (tokens).
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use a library like NLTK or TextBlob to determine if a review is "Positive" or "Negative".
3. **Word Embeddings**: Understand Word2Vec and how words can be represented as mathematical vectors.
4. **Transformers**: Research the architecture behind models like GPT and BERT.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a "Spam Filter" that analyzes a short text and predicts the probability that it is a spam message based on keywords.
