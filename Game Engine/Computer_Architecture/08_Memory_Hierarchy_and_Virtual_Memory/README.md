# Problem Set 08: Memory Hierarchy and Virtual Memory

### **Goal**
Understand the layers of memory from registers to disk.

### **Tasks**
1. **The Pyramid**: Order L1, L2, L3 cache, RAM, and SSD by speed and size.
2. **Page Tables**: Explain how Virtual Addresses are mapped to Physical Addresses.
3. **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)**: Why do we need a cache for address translations?
4. **Page Faults**: What happens when the CPU requests data that isn't in RAM?

### **Practice Drill**
Calculate the effective access time given a hit rate of 95% for L1 cache and 100ns access time for main memory.
