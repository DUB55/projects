# Problem Set 10: DevOps Capstone Project

### **Goal**
Integrate all DevOps skills into a single, cohesive project.

### **Tasks**
1. **Application Setup**: Choose a simple web application (e.g., a Go or Node.js app).
2. **Containerization**: Create a multi-stage Dockerfile for the application.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Build a pipeline that runs tests, builds the image, and pushes it to a registry.
4. **Infrastructure**: Use Terraform to provision a Kubernetes cluster (or a set of VMs).
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the application to the infrastructure using Kubernetes manifests or Helm.
6. **Monitoring**: Set up basic monitoring and logging for the deployed application.

### **Final Drill**
Perform a "Blue-Green" or "Canary" deployment of a new version of your application with zero downtime.
