# Help: Blender Mastery

## Common Issues
- **I'm lost in the 3D view**: Press `Numpad .` to focus on the selected object. Press `Home` to see everything.
- **My object is pink**: This usually means a texture file is missing. Check your `Shading` tab.
- **Render is taking forever**: Check your `Sampling` settings in the Render properties. Switch to `Eevee` for faster (but less realistic) previews.
- **I can't select anything**: Check if you are in `Edit Mode` vs `Object Mode` (`Tab`). Also check the outliner (top right) to see if selection is disabled.
