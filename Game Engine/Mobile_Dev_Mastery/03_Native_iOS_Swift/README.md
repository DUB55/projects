# Native iOS Development (Swift)

Building for the Apple ecosystem.

## Concepts
- **Swift**: Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language.
- **SwiftUI**: The modern way to build UIs for all Apple platforms.
- **Auto Layout**: Designing interfaces that adapt to any screen size.
- **App Lifecycle**: How the OS manages your app (Active, Inactive, Background).

## Challenge
1. Create a "Flashcard App" using SwiftUI.
2. Use "Core Data" to persist the user's flashcards.
3. Research the "Apple Human Interface Guidelines" (HIG) for best UX practices on iOS.
