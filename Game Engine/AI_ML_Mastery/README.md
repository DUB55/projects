# AI & ML Mastery: Intelligent Entities

Artificial Intelligence in games ranges from simple decision trees to complex neural networks that learn to play against humans.

## Curriculum
1. [01_State_Machines](./01_State_Machines/README.md) - Finite State Machines (FSM): The foundation of NPC behavior.
2. [02_Pathfinding_AStar](./02_Pathfinding_AStar/README.md) - How entities find the shortest path from A to B.
3. [03_Behavior_Trees](./03_Behavior_Trees/README.md) - Hierarchical logic for complex NPC decision making.
4. [04_Neural_Networks](./04_Neural_Networks/README.md) - Basic concepts of weights, biases, and backpropagation.
5. [05_Reinforcement_Learning](./05_Reinforcement_Learning/README.md) - Training agents through trial and error (ML-Agents).
