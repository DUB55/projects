# Problem Set 09: Sharding and Replication

### **Goal**
Scale databases to handle massive traffic and ensure high availability.

### **Tasks**
1. **Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling**: When should you buy a bigger server vs adding more servers?
2. **Read Replicas**: How does replication improve read performance?
3. **Database Sharding**: Explain how to split a large table across multiple databases based on a "Shard Key".
4. **CAP Theorem**: Explain the trade-off between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

### **Practice Drill**
Design a sharding strategy for a "Global Chat App" with millions of users.
