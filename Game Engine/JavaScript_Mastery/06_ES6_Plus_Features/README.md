# Problem Set 06: ES6+ Features

### **Goal**
Use modern JavaScript syntax to write cleaner code.

### **Tasks**
1. **Destructuring**: Extract properties from an object and elements from an array into variables.
2. **Spread/Rest**: Use `...` to clone an object and to collect arguments into an array.
3. **Template Literals**: Use backticks and `${}` for string interpolation.
4. **Arrow Functions**: Understand the difference in `this` binding between arrow and regular functions.

### **Practice Drill**
Write a function that takes an array of objects and uses destructuring and template literals to print a summary for each object.
