# Problem Set 05: Kubernetes Orchestration

### **Goal**
Manage containerized applications at scale.

### **Tasks**
1. **Pods and Nodes**: Explain the relationship between a Pod and a Node.
2. **Deployments**: Create a YAML file for a Deployment with 3 replicas of an Nginx web server.
3. **Services**: Differentiate between `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, and `LoadBalancer`.
4. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: How do you inject environment variables into a Pod?

### **Practice Drill**
Deploy a simple "Hello World" app to a local Kubernetes cluster (like Minikube or Kind) and scale it to 5 replicas.
