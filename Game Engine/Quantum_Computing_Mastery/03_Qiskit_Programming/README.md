# Programming with Qiskit

Writing code for real quantum computers.

## Concepts
- **Qiskit**: IBM's open-source framework for quantum computing.
- **Quantum Circuits**: Visualizing and building quantum programs.
- **Simulators vs. Real Hardware**: Running code on your laptop vs. a real quantum processor.
- **Aer and Terra**: The core components of the Qiskit library.

## Challenge
1. Install Qiskit using `pip install qiskit`.
2. Build a simple circuit that puts a qubit into superposition and measure it.
3. Run your circuit on a simulator and look at the results (should be 50% 0 and 50% 1).
