# Problem Set 07: Load Balancing & Proxies

### **Goal**
Learn how to handle massive amounts of traffic by distributing work.

### **Tasks**
1. **Reverse Proxy**: Explain how Nginx or HAProxy sits in front of web servers.
2. **Load Balancing Algorithms**: Compare `Round Robin`, `Least Connections`, and `IP Hash`.
3. **Health Checks**: How does a load balancer know if a server is down?
4. **Caching Proxies**: Explain how a CDN (Content Delivery Network) like Cloudflare works.

### **Practice Drill**
Set up a simple Nginx configuration that balances traffic between two different local web servers.
