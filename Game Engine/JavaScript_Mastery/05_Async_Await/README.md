# Problem Set 05: Async/Await and Promises

### **Goal**
Handle asynchronous operations gracefully.

### **Tasks**
1. **Promises**: Create a Promise that resolves after 2 seconds.
2. **Fetch API**: Use `fetch()` to get data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).
3. **Async/Await**: Rewrite the fetch call using `async` and `await`.
4. **Error Handling**: Use `try...catch` to handle network errors in an async function.

### **Practice Drill**
Build a "Weather Dashboard" that fetches data from an API and displays it on the screen.
