# Problem Set 07: Classes and Prototypes

### **Goal**
Understand Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript.

### **Tasks**
1. **Class Declaration**: Create a `Character` class with a constructor and a method.
2. **Inheritance**: Create a `Player` class that `extends Character`.
3. **Prototypes**: Add a method to the `Array.prototype` (carefully!).
4. **Private Fields**: Use the `#` syntax for private class members.

### **Practice Drill**
Build a small "RPG Combat Simulator" with classes for different types of heroes and enemies.
