## 🚀 Success Indicators

### You're Ready When You Can Answer:
- [ ] What are the 12 phases? (in order)
- [ ] What does the MVP include? (Phase 5)
- [ ] What tech stack are we using? (and why)
- [ ] What's our performance target? (60 FPS, < 3 sec startup)
- [ ] How do we store data? (SQLite + OS keychain, no backend)
- [ ] What's the team structure? (assigned)
- [ ] When do we ship v1.0? (Day 90, or compressed timeline)
- [ ] How do we validate each phase? (PHASE_CHECKLISTS.md)

### Red Flags:
- 🚩 "I don't understand the architecture"
  → Re-read BLUEPRINT.md architecture section

- 🚩 "We need to start coding before Phase 1"
  → Check BLUEPRINT.md Phase 1 (foundation first)

- 🚩 "Can we skip Phase 6?" (animations)
  → No, but can compress from 15 days to 8 days with 2 developers

- 🚩 "Timeline seems too tight"
  → It's 90 days for 1 person, 45-50 for 3 people. Scope can be compressed to MVP (40 days).

## 📞 Questions & Troubleshooting

### Q: "What if Phase X takes longer than estimated?"
**A:** Report blocker immediately. Adjust timeline. Document learnings for next project.  
→ See QUICK_START.md "Known Risks & Mitigation"

### Q: "Can we parallelize more?"
**A:** Yes! See TASK_TRACKER.md "Parallel Work Opportunities"  
→ UI and Core can develop in parallel from Phase 2 onwards

### Q: "What if we want to ship MVP faster?"
**A:** Stop at Phase 5. Skip Phases 6–12. Or compress Phase 6 (animations) to Phase 6.5.  
→ See QUICK_START.md "Timeline Compression"

### Q: "Do we need all these documents?"
**A:** Yes. Each serves a different purpose:
- EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY → stakeholders
- QUICK_START → team leads
- BLUEPRINT → architecture deep dive
- TASK_TRACKER → team management
- PHASE_CHECKLISTS → daily execution

### Q: "Can I start building before Phase 1?"
**A:** No. Phase 1 (foundation) is critical. SQLite schema, logging, Qt bootstrap must be done first.  
→ See BLUEPRINT.md Phase 1

### Q: "Which document should I share with X?"
```
Stakeholder/CEO     → EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md + QUICK_START.md
Engineering Lead    → BLUEPRINT.md + TASK_TRACKER.md
Developer (Phase 1) → QUICK_START.md + PHASE_CHECKLISTS.md (Phase 1) + BLUEPRINT.md (Phase 1)
QA / Testing        → PHASE_CHECKLISTS.md + BLUEPRINT.md (validation sections)
Designer            → BLUEPRINT.md (Vision & Design Language section)
```
