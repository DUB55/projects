# Problem Set 10: Data Science in Production

### **Goal**
Deploy models and build automated pipelines.

### **Tasks**
1. **Model Serialization**: Save a trained model using `pickle` or `joblib`.
2. **Flask/FastAPI**: Create a simple web API that serves model predictions.
3. **Docker**: Containerize your data science environment.
4. **Monitoring**: How do you detect "Model Drift" when the real-world data changes?

### **Practice Drill**
Build a "Predictor API" that takes JSON input and returns a prediction from your trained model.
