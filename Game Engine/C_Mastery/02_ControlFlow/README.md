# Problem Set 2: Control Flow

Now we make our programs smart! We'll learn how to make decisions and repeat tasks.

## Concepts Covered
- **If / Else If / Else**: Conditional logic.
- **For Loops**: When you know how many times to repeat.
- **While Loops**: When you repeat until a condition changes.
- **Switch Statements**: Choosing between multiple discrete options.

## The Exercises

### 1. Even or Odd?
Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints whether it is even or odd.

### 2. The Multiplier
Use a `for` loop to print the multiplication table of a number entered by the user (from 1 to 10).

### 3. Guess the Number
Create a simple "Guess the Number" game. Set a hidden number (e.g., 7) and use a `while` loop to keep asking the user for a guess until they get it right.

## Tips
- Use the modulo operator `%` to check for even/odd (e.g., `num % 2 == 0`).
- Remember that `==` is for comparison, while `=` is for assignment!
