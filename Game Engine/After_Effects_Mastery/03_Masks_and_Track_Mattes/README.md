# Problem Set 03: Masks and Track Mattes

### **Goal**
Learn how to hide and reveal parts of layers.

### **Tasks**
1. **Pen Tool**: Draw a mask on a layer to isolate a specific shape.
2. **Mask Expansion & Feather**: Adjust these to soften or grow the masked area.
3. **Track Mattes**: Use one layer (Alpha or Luma) to define the transparency of the layer below it.
4. **Inverted Masks**: Toggle the `Invert` switch on a mask.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a "Text Reveal" effect. Use a rectangular mask to hide text, then animate the text moving "out" from behind the mask's edge.
