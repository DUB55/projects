# Problem Set 10: Distributed Systems Networking

### **Goal**
Understand the networking challenges unique to large-scale distributed systems.

### **Tasks**
1. **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**: Explain how one server can call a function on another (gRPC, Thrift).
2. **Service Discovery**: How do servers find each other in a dynamic cloud environment (Consul, Etcd)?
3. **CAP Theorem**: Understand the trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
4. **Consistency Models**: Explain "Eventual Consistency" vs "Strong Consistency".

### **Practice Drill**
Research how Netflix or Spotify handles millions of concurrent users across the globe using a distributed architecture.
