# Problem Set 06: Heaps and Priority Queues

### **Goal**
Master the binary heap data structure for efficient priority management.

### **Tasks**
1. **Min-Heap vs. Max-Heap**: Understand the parent-child relationship in a binary heap.
2. **Insertion & Extraction**: Implement the "Sift Up" and "Sift Down" (Bubble Up/Down) logic.
3. **Heap Sort**: Use a heap to sort an array in O(n log n) time.
4. **Priority Queues**: Use a priority queue to manage a list of tasks with different importance levels.

### **Practice Drill**
Find the "K-th Largest Element" in an unsorted array using a Min-Heap.
