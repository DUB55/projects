# Problem Set 02: Keyframes and Interpolation

### **Goal**
Master the timing and feel of motion.

### **Tasks**
1. **Setting Keyframes**: Click the stopwatch to start animating.
2. **Easy Ease**: Select keyframes and press `F9`.
3. **Graph Editor**: Use the `Value Graph` and `Speed Graph` to create a "snappy" movement (fast start, slow finish).
4. **Motion Blur**: Enable the `Motion Blur` switch for the layer and the composition.

### **Practice Drill**
Animate a "Logo Reveal". Have a logo fly in from the left, bounce slightly, and settle in the center. Use the Graph Editor to make the movement feel professional and smooth.
