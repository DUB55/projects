# Problem Set 07: Security in DevOps (DevSecOps)

### **Goal**
Integrate security into the entire development lifecycle.

### **Tasks**
1. **SAST vs DAST**: Compare Static vs Dynamic Application Security Testing.
2. **Container Scanning**: Use a tool like Trivy to find vulnerabilities in a Docker image.
3. **Secret Management**: Why should you never commit secrets to Git? (Use HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager).
4. **Policy as Code**: Use Open Policy Agent (OPA) to enforce security rules on Kubernetes manifests.

### **Practice Drill**
Run a security scan on a public GitHub repository and identify at least 3 potential vulnerabilities.
