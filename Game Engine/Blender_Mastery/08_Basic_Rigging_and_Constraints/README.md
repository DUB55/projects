# Problem Set 08: Basic Rigging and Constraints

### **Goal**
Learn how to create a skeleton (armature) and parent meshes to it for animation.

### **Tasks**
1. **Armature**: Add a single bone (`Shift + A` -> `Armature`).
2. **Extruding Bones**: In Edit Mode, use `E` to extrude a chain of bones.
3. **Parenting**: Select Mesh, then Armature, and press `Ctrl + P` -> `With Automatic Weights`.
4. **Pose Mode**: Move the bones to see the mesh deform.

### **Practice Drill**
Create a simple "Waving Arm" or "Robot Leg". Rig it with at least 3 bones and ensure the mesh deforms smoothly at the joints.
