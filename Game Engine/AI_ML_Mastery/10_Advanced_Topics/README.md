# Problem Set 10: Advanced Topics

### **Goal**
Explore the cutting edge of AI research and ethical considerations.

### **Tasks**
1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Understand how two competing networks can create realistic images.
2. **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Learn how to interpret *why* a complex model made a specific decision.
3. **AI Ethics**: Research bias in training data and the social impact of automation.
4. **Future Trends**: Read about Multi-modal models (like GPT-4V) and AI safety.

### **Practice Drill**
Write a short report (or README) analyzing a real-world case where AI bias caused a problem, and suggest three ways it could have been prevented.
