# Stage 1: Deconstruction (Decomposition)

Decomposition is the process of breaking a complex problem into parts that are easier to conceive, understand, program, and maintain.

## The Mental Exercise
If you were asked to "Build a Game Engine", your brain might freeze. It's too big.
But if you break it down:
1. "I need a way to open a window."
2. "I need a way to draw a square."
3. "I need a way to move that square."
Suddenly, it becomes doable.

## Exercises

### 1. The Sandwich Algorithm
Write down the exact, step-by-step instructions for a robot to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 
- *Crucial*: Be literal. If you don't tell the robot to "open the jar", it will try to put the knife through the glass.
- *Goal*: Realize how many small steps we take for granted.

### 2. Deconstructing "Tetris"
List every single "System" required to make Tetris work.
- Example: Gravity system, Rotation system, Line-clearing system, Input system.
- *Goal*: See the components of a game before you write a single line of code.

### 3. The "Why" Chain
Take a complex problem (e.g., "The game is lagging"). Ask "Why?" 5 times to get to the root cause.
- *Goal*: Move from "symptoms" to "root causes".
