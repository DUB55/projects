# Problem Set 08: Virtualization & Hypervisors

### **Goal**
Understand the technology that allows multiple operating systems to share the same hardware.

### **Tasks**
1. **Type 1 vs. Type 2 Hypervisors**: Compare VMware ESXi (Type 1) with VirtualBox (Type 2).
2. **Hardware-Assisted Virtualization**: What are Intel VT-x and AMD-V?
3. **Containers vs. VMs**: How is Docker different from a Virtual Machine in terms of the kernel?
4. **Paravirtualization**: How can a guest OS be modified to run more efficiently on a hypervisor?

### **Practice Drill**
Explain why a Virtual Machine has a full copy of an OS, while a Docker container shares the host's kernel.
