# Problem Set 06: Computer Vision

### **Goal**
Understand how machines "see" and interpret visual data.

### **Tasks**
1. **Image Preprocessing**: Use OpenCV to resize, grayscale, and blur an image.
2. **Edge Detection**: Implement Canny Edge Detection to find outlines in a photo.
3. **Object Detection**: Use a pre-trained YOLO or Haar Cascade model to detect faces or cars.
4. **CNNs**: Understand how Convolutional Neural Networks work for image classification.

### **Practice Drill**
Build a simple "Face Detector" script that draws a rectangle around any faces detected in a live webcam feed.
