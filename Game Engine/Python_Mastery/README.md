# Python Mastery: The High-Level Power

Python is the perfect language for prototyping, automation, and data science. While C/C++ are about *how* the computer works, Python is about *what* you want the computer to do.

## Why Python?
1.  **Speed of Development**: You can write in 10 lines what would take 100 in C++.
2.  **Batteries Included**: The standard library is massive.
3.  **Versatility**: Used in AI (PyTorch), Web (Django), and Scripting.

## Note for Game Engine Developers
Python is rarely used for the *core* of a high-performance game engine (rendering, physics). However, it is **frequently** used for:
- **Tooling**: Building the map editor or asset exporters.
- **Scripting**: Writing the game logic (AI, Quests) while the engine runs in C++.
- **Blender**: The most popular 3D modeling tool is scripted entirely in Python.
